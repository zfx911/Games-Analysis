    "text": "Summary\nIn conclusion, our analysis reveals a strong preference within the gaming community for either positive or negative sentiments, with neutral reactions being notably scarce. The dominance of terms like ‘help’ among top negative keywords suggests a dislike for posts seeking assistance, particularly noticeable across various top-selling games. Positive sentiments correlate with multiplayer and online modes, while negative perceptions are associated with bugs in console games. The sentiment analysis on reactions to video games’ eSports events highlights a pervasive negative sentiment during competitive periods, reflecting the high stakes and emotional investment of fans and players. This insight presents a business opportunity for game developers and community managers to strategically plan positive engagement strategies, such as improved support systems, engaging content, and interactive platforms during events.\n\n50 Years of Gaming History, by Revenue Stream (1970-2020)\nThe machine learning analysis uncovers nuances in Reddit author influence, emphasizing that a high volume of posts does not necessarily translate to high influence. The impact of an author is contingent on overall scores and may be limited by the controversial nature of their posts. Additionally, critical factors influencing game sales include critic scores, publisher reputation, and the compatibility of game genres with specific consoles. The identification of interaction effects between consoles and genres offers strategic insights for game developers and publishers, facilitating informed decision-making in the competitive gaming market.\n\nThe gaming industry’s revenues far outstrip other entertainment sectors Image: Newzoo Global Games Market Report\nHowever, our project encounters several limitations. The classification model’s performance is influenced by a scarcity of training features, leading to suboptimal predictive capabilities despite the overarching goal of identifying key features for the electronic game market share. Furthermore, the limitations extend to the incompleteness of external data, particularly post-2019, attributed to the onset of the pandemic, which has significantly influenced the gaming market. While a time series chart highlights a sharp decline in game sales post-2019, the negligible impact on historical gaming trends contrasts with its substantial influence on recent trends, particularly within the last five years. The pandemic, considered an outlier, introduces an external factor affecting the entire gaming industry’s economic landscape, warranting further exploration as a potential new research topic. Additionally, the integration of Reddit data with external sources for statistically trackable sales is restricted to specific platforms and standalone games, excluding major players like LoL, Dota 2, CS:GO, and Valorant, which operate on a free-to-play model with in-game purchases. The absence of sales data for these games necessitates reliance on insights derived solely from the Reddit community, limiting the analysis to gauging their popularity without the quantitative sales metrics crucial for a comprehensive understanding of their market impact.\nMoving forward, our project envisions several crucial next steps to enhance the depth and scope of our analyses. First and foremost, we propose refining our sentiment analysis model to better capture the subtle nuances of gaming community reactions, especially focusing on the middle ground of neutral sentiments that our current model overlooks. This adjustment will provide a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences. Furthermore, in addressing the limitations related to Reddit author influence, we intend to develop a better algorithm that considers both post volume and the controversial nature of posts, providing a more accurate measure of author impact. To mitigate the impact of external factors, particularly the pandemic, on gaming trends, we propose conducting a separate analysis that disentangles the pandemic’s effects from broader market dynamics. Above all, future endeavors will include refining our machine learning models to better predict author influence and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of controversial posts."
