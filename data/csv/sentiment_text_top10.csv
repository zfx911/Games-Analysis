assassinscreed,"[Spoilers] The Ezio Trilogy is still the best part of the franchise for me, it just had more ""heart"" than the last few games","Since the RPG era started I don't see that much love for the Ezio Trilogy anymore. Many say it has aged badly, that its too linear etc.

But for me its still the best part of the series. It had the classic Assassins Creed vibe without any distractions. The focus was on Assassins 100%. The setting (Renaissance Italy) is still my favourite, it was small compared to the last few maps but had so much more identity.

Ezio is still the best developed character of the series. He did get 3 games  but I think back then the writing was in general much better. I mean games like Valhalla and Odyssey are basically as long as the whole Ezio Trilogy but the stories are lacking and the main characters are underdeveloped.

Seeing Ezio develop from a revenge driven brat to a wise and experienced Master Assassin was just awesome. Embers was the perfect send off. And of course the Modern Day was the best here, Desmond story felt like it was going somehwere interesting.

In general I preferred the games when they were more linear and had the quality over quantity approach tbh.",CallOfDuty,pos

So I think as far as I‚Äôve gotten in the process of figuring out that I can get all my mons from the GBA games into Diamond by just putting them both into the DS at the same time and transferring them to Pal Park, is that right?

Then the next step is to get these guys on Diamond and Black into Pok√©mon Bank? 

But it doesn‚Äôt seem like Bank is available on the original DS, so I‚Äôm going to have to go and purchase a 3DS or a 2DS, is that right?

And then from bank I can transfer them to Home?

Out of these teams, 4/7 would have gotten the second upgrade: France, Germany, Portugal and Wales.

pokemon,"Thinking of fake signature Pok√©mon moves, day 234: Gallade","I am coming up with at least 1 fake move that would be exclusive to 1 Pok√©mon or an evolutionary line of Pok√©mon. I am going in Pok√©dex order, and I will skip every Pok√©mon or evolutionary line that already has a Pok√©mon in it that has a signature move. Signature Z-moves or G-Max moves don't count. Also, I don't make moves for Pok√©mon to make them better in battle. While it may make them more usable, that is not my intent most of the time, I just make moves to give the Pok√©mon something they need, deserve or are said they can do, but aren't able to do with their current movesets.

I'm skipping over Gliscor, mamoswine and Porygon-Z because I already gave their pre-evolutions moves. And in the case of Porygon-Z, it already has Conversion and Conversion 2 as its signature moves anyways, which makes Porygon-Z the only gen 4 evolution of a Pok√©mon introduced in a previous generation to have a signature move, and it has 2 as well.

Gallade's move is called Psych Slash, a Psychic-Type Physical move with 95 base power, 100% accuracy and 10 PP. It uses the target's Special Defense when calculating damage.

The move is performed by the user powering its muscles and blades with psychic energy, after which the user strikes. Because of the user's blades and muscles being powered by psychic energy, the move targets the opponent's Special defense rather than the target's physical Defense.

Yes, I know it would make more sense to just keep it simple and use the target's physical Defense but there is no Physical move yet that damages the opponent with their Special Defense. There are Special move that deal Physical damage, but not the other way around. And what better Pok√©mon to give a move like this to than a Psychic-Fighting-Type Pok√©mon, Gallade. The Psychic-Type is mostly a Special type, and the Fighting-Type is mostly a Physical type. So making a move that utilizes both the physical and special properties of both types would be pretty interesting. It's quite funny that Psychic and Fighting are also the types of the 2 Special moves that always deal Physical damage, those being Psyshock and Secret Sword. Photon Geyser can deal Physical damage as well, but not all the time. But yeah, it seems like only Fighting and especially Psychic-Type moves get this unique effect. I'll try to branch this effect to more types in the future but for now, I'll just play it safe and go with the reverse.

I'd love to hear feedback or questions about my ideas, and if you have any ideas for signature moves for Pok√©mon, I'd love to hear them, I might use the ideas (with your consent of course)! Even though this is a daily thing, or at least, I'll try to keep it daily, I don't think I'll be consistent with the time of day I post another idea.",pokemon,pos

FIFA,Tots Chiesa Short Review,"For anyone looking for a work horse winger, this guy is a true gem. He was crucial in my run up for elite and constantly tormented opposition fullbacks with his rapid pace. He perpetually moves in the final third, kinda like a real life Muller (Chiesa does it too). His shooting is clinical and his final ball is on point. 

One common comparison i‚Äôve seen people make is with Fb El Shaarawy, but the only similarities are league and nation. Chiesa brings a lot more work rate and presence out wide and goes to war all game. He has a surprising shielding ability which allows him to face even the toughest fullbacks like Mbabu. El Sha is better in central positions though due to the skills and slightly better feel. 

I played him off chem with finisher and he was perfectly fine. All in all, a complete winger whose work rate out wide sets him apart from others.",pokemon,pos
assassinscreed,An idea for an assassins creed* game that is stylized more similarly to the WoA trilogy,"I‚Äôve been playing through odyssey and I‚Äôm about to start on origins, odyssey has been a ton of fun and I can‚Äôt wait to start origins. I‚Äôve also been playing the new hitman 3 which is a series I‚Äôm also a big fan of. It made me start thinking about how AC could really capitalize on their formula.

For those of you that aren‚Äôt familiar- The new hitman ‚Äúworld of assassination‚Äù trilogy is a sandbox game where you go to various locations, with various weapons and items you can start the mission with or collect in the world. Your objective is to eliminate a target on the map, you‚Äôre highly encouraged to use stealth and there‚Äôs a ton of amazing mechanics worth checking out.

My idea for a game like this set in the assassins creed universe is very similar to this. It would be called ‚Äúanimus‚Äù or ‚Äúthe animus‚Äù or whatever anyone wants to call it, but the idea would be rather than agent 47 traveling to Miami, Paris, Dubai etc. to carry out a hit- a new character in modern day AC universe enters the animus to perform specific assassinations throughout AC history, giving the character the same or similar mechanics to hitman- a target on a small-medium sized sandbox map with various weapons, items, disguises and ways to assassinate the target. Rather than playing as 1 assassin (or Templar or not assassin if you‚Äôre playing odyssey like me lol) in 1 time period- you‚Äôre playing as maybe a half dozen per entry. Rather than destinations, you‚Äôd have time periods like ancient Egypt, Greece, or Rome. We could even see places that we‚Äôve never seen an AC title, like Japan, China, India, or middle and southern Africa. You could disguise yourself in the armor or uniforms of the enemies that person had in their time period. You could use the weapons and tools they used in those time periods.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve explained it clearly. If there‚Äôs any confusion I‚Äôm happy to answer questions. For those that have played a WoA hitman game- imagine that game but you‚Äôre Altair/Ezio/Connor with his kit trying to stealthily assassinate any person he‚Äôs ever assassinated in their time period.",pokemon,neg

pokemon,My ideas for a new Pokemon Game: Pokemon Body and Spirit,"Instead of being a ""breath of the wild"" for pokemon I just want games that really focus on the core of pokemon: catching and battling.

To improve the fun of finding and catching wild pokemon, my idea would be that each version of pokemon has 3-4 wild area ""templates"". Ie every time you restart the game the template resets - maybe in one your common bird is pidgey, in another its starly. This means in reality there's far greater incentives to trade and explore for rare pokemon.

The other big idea: no more type-themed gyms.

Instead the gyms would be themed by ""mantra"" - which would lean into fighting styles For example:

Courage

 - Fight style: Lower accuracy/high power attacks, and attacks with recoil

 - Teaches: risk vs reward, value of moves other than plain stab moves

 - Rewards: Scope lens, TM: any move with recoil

Endurance

 - Fight style: Full 6 pokemon team, Sturdy pokemon with healing moves, gym leader uses items

 - Teaches: How to deal major damage quickly or use status moves effectively to hamper opposition, need for a large balanced team

 - Rewards: Leftovers

The mantras could really teach players actual fight styles and strategies along the way. And elite 4 could use common (but maybe weakened) online meta strategies.

And finally, It‚Äôd be great to also have every town have something fun aesthetically (which Gamefreak actually have a great history of doing) and 1 reason to come back regularly to every town. Some possible reasons to make a town remain important long-term:

‚Ä¢	TM and/or HM specialist town ‚Äì more options with increasing badges
‚Ä¢	Pokeball specialist town
‚Ä¢	Library/museum town ‚Äì Access to a ton of information that most people go to the internet for anyways (but kids might not know to) ‚Äì type advantages, when/how pokemon evolve etc
‚Ä¢	Breeding specialist town ‚Äì long path for eggs near daycare, maybe a few new features
‚Ä¢	Pokemon competition city

Sorry if you find some typing issues: english is not my first language and this essay was translated from spanish through GT.

&amp;#x200B;

First we are going to talk about what is the graphics, both technical and artistic, which is apparently the only sin of this game despite being the most superficial aspect possible to criticize. Yes, the game is technically unfortunate: it is true that Nintendo Switch is not a PS5 and not even a PS4, but those of you who say that it is not capable of giving something better than this are lying. The textures are very poor, sometimes seeming to be at 144p, and there is a very obvious effect of repetition of textures that I haven't seen in many years. The game sometimes looks more pixelated than a PS1 game, with horrific jagged teeth all over the place that draw a lot of attention. But the worst part is the drawing distance and the popping that is due to it. Absolutely everything materializes out of complete nothingness within 10 meters of the player, and not small details: sets of trees, Pok√©mon, characters, and even entire mountains. Come on, absolutely everything loads in front of the player's face without to a degree that I have not seen in my life: it's just distracting. All so that, despite looking so poor and even without all these problems that I mention, the game runs at an unstable 30 FPS. Such a poor graphics could be forgivable in an hallway simulator or an indie game; but the fact is, when we talk about open or semi-open world games as is the case, the graphics play an important role, as there are lots of landscapes and environments in which the player spends hours, and if the technical section is so terrible that it completely destroys the artistic section and consequently both are really wak and even unpleasant to see, we already have a pretty big problem. The worst part is, the only thing the game needs to load are some dead maps with poor interaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Here we go from a superficial point to a much more important one, focusing on the gameplay. The scenarios - the maps, although at first it may not seem like it, are completely dead, there is no life, there is nothing. The only thing there is are Pok√©mon and more Pok√©mon walking around in a loop without absolutely any kind of interaction between them or with the elements of the scenarios themselves, without any kind of routine, being only Pok√© Ball meat and nothing else. Exploration is completely non-existent. Do you remember when in Zelda Breath of the Wild, many kilometers away, you glimpsed one or several points of interest, you were heading towards them and, along the way, you glimpsed another point of interest that made you change your route? Well, both things in Legends Arceus are non-existent. The maps don't invite the player to explore, they don't attract attention, you don't see points of interest because basically there aren't any, so all you have left is to go around randomly to see which random Pok√©mon the game wants to throw at you, my God how satisfying. Imagine you want to capture an Electabuzz, and wonder where the heck you could get your hands on one. Then, an NPC tells you about an abandoned chateau which was invaded by Electric-type Pok√©mon that overloaded the network system. In the distance, on a hill, you see a chateau that grabs your attention, we make our way there overcoming obstacles and being forced to change our path before some of them, to finally reach it and find ourselves, among other species, a group of Electabuzz. This doesn't happen in Legends: you're walking around in a snowy area and suddenly a wild Electabuzz appears, tell me what the hell a freaking Electabuzz is doing in an area like that. And it is not surprising that the distribution of the Pok√©mon is so poor, when the areas are all almost the same: we have 5 different areas to go through, of which 3 are practically identical, another one is similar too but that at least includes a mountain, and another which is the snowy area that I am talking about, which visually stands out from the rest. But it is still a pretty poor variety of environments, which is worsened by the fact that, as I say, they are empty. Wouldn't you like to see a graveyard where ghost-type Pokemon live? Abandoned crypts and monasteries? Lairs? Or at least that not all the areas use the same visual style, it seems that you are seeing the same thing all the time with some addition to differentiate;  and as it should happen with Pok√©mon, with human NPCs with their routines, true civilizations unlike what is in the game (there are literally 2 towns with literally 4 shacks each, even the Pok√©mon for the Game Boy had better than that.)

&amp;#x200B;

The game is what it is, capture Pok√©mon to infinity. I don't know if catching Pok√©mon is the favorite activity for most; mine certainly isn't, and this game is almost all about that and it's not even that interesting, because its main mechanic is catching and, despite that, it has no depth, it is extremely simple. Despite this, at first it's fine because it's new and in the main series there wasn't any game like that, but then it gets tiresome because you can't even finish making a definitive team; you will always be alternating Pok√©mon. Some may be fine with it, but the level curve for wild Pok√©mon continues to advance and there comes a moment when you find yourself with very powerful Pok√©mon to catch. Those Pok√©mon are being given to you, you haven't trained them and you haven't made any notable effort to obtain them. You can be training your Pok√©mon, have for example a Staravia, and suddenly find a much more powerful Staraptor. There is no difficulty in finding or capturing it and it is a really powerful Pok√©mon. If you capture it, you destroy the training you have done with your Starly. And, even so, it is what the game wants you to do, to replace your effort with little gifts, because the game is made for you to alternate your team. Seems like a shitty approach to me. We all like to have a strong team; what few think is that the grace of having strong Pok√©mon is the difficulty of getting them, not the fact of having them in the face. Do you remember that weak but attractively designed Shinx that became a Luxio, became more competent, and finally became a Luxray with a fearsome design and a power, by that point in the game, quite important? It was an incredible feeling, because as always, the journey is more satisfying than the end. Here‚Ä¶ none of that; you access a random map of the game and 20 bloody meters from the entrance there are Luxrays, random Luxrays, given away.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Game Freak has tried to make a good game. However, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan open world where you capture all kinds of Pok√©mon does not work for me, it is an approach that has neither head nor tail. Wild Pok√©mon can't be very strong; at most they can be a previous form of a strong Pok√©mon, but not a strong Pok√©mon because it is absolutely no fun to get them and they make it seem that your training with yours has been a waste of time. I was stunned to see a Staraptor above my level flying so freely around, much more powerful than my Staravia and in a random area without any access difficulty or theme that accompanies the Pok√©mon. I have not made merits to have that killing machine, the game has put it in front of my face and apart from the fact that you find it by chance, capturing it is very easy. Ok, you can keep your Staravia and move on from that Staraptor, but you still feel like shit because it seems that your effort was in vain. What makes you sweat using them to fight and you are only interested in capturing them? Well, very well, but then we are turning this game into a very simple collecting exercise, and that can entertain you, there is nothing wrong with doing so: the problem is that entertaining is not difficult, the difficulty lies in entertaining with quality; and if your only argument to defend something is that it's very entertaining then you can't last even half a round in a debate. I can go to Burger King, you can tell me it's fucking shit food, I'll accept it and still go eat there because I like to eat shit. But I know that I don't have a chance defending that junk food with the argument of ""well, I like it"".

&amp;#x200B;

In this game the Pok√©mon are more evenly matched in the sense that you can defeat a Pok√©mon well above your level and vice versa. But that to me is not necessarily a good thing; rather on the contrary, it seems rather negative to me because the progression you feel from your skills and your equipment is much less. This is what I lack in general: satisfaction. I absolutely don't care if my Pok√©mon are about to evolve because I know I'm going to find their evolved versions before then or at higher levels if not. I don't care about leveling up because there isn't that much of a difference between level 30 and level 50 Pok√©mon. I don't care if I run into strong Pok√©mon because I haven't done anything to deserve them, the game just put them in my face. Regarding the levels, it is clear that in this way the terrible level curve of the enemies can be hidden: I mean, in this game we have three types of battles: those of the trainers, those of the wild Pok√©mon and those of the lords (the boss fights). The first ones, in addition to being scarce and scripted, are a bad joke: you will always overleveled compared to them and they will not present any opposition even if you face three Pok√©mon at the same time despite you are alone. Within the main adventure, the only exception are the two final fights, which feature a random level jump, but they are not difficult at all. Fighting against wild Pok√©mon is not difficult at all because their AI is not very sharp and they go against your entire team; not even the alpha Pok√©mon, which are something like mini-zone boss Pok√©mon, pose any challenge, because no matter how much level they have, between which there is not so much difference in power despite the difference in levels, that the game spoils the advantages of types and that it is a 6 against 1 they do not give much trouble either, neither to defeat them nor to capture them. Finally we have the lords, some large yellow Pok√©mon that act as bosses of each of the 5 areas of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone on Discord told me, without being complicated at all, these fights do force you to take things a little more seriously, why do I say that they told me about it and not according to my experience? Because basically I didn't do any of thesde fights, NOT a single one. When facing these enemies, you have to dodge their attacks and throw bait at them to stun them, moment when you should take the opportunity to take out your Pok√©mon and fight. The problem is that this baiting mechanic is so ridiculously broken that you can endlessly bait these Pok√©mon until you defeat them, doing nothing but dodging and spamming a button. And defeating them this way is so easy that even the FPS drops here don't bother you too much. That is to say, that during the game you make a Pok√©mon team as strong as you can so that in what is equivalent to the bosses of the game it is more worthwhile not to fight with your Pok√©mon than to do so, because if you fight with your Pok√©mon, the game becomes more difficult. Do you realize what a design horror this is? I swear to you, you shouldn't be able to defeat these enemies like this because it's a bloody Pok√©mon game, the important thing is the Pok√©mon and they're what should shine at times like this, and don't come with the argument that it's that the game gives you freedom because it is not exactly a game that abounds due to the infinite playable possibilities. But the worst thing is that it is very easy to abuse this broken mechanic by having infinite baits and enemy patterns being so telegraphed and predictable. It's awful. And that I read on Twitter that it was the most difficult game in the series. This is the first time I've finished a Pok√©mon's main quest without losing once, without having a single Revive in battle, without buying anything, and without ever using a single potion, healing item, or life recovery move during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Ah, he left me the mechanics of the mounts, adapted to the playable style of this installment, of course; and the truth... is that like everything else, they are poorly implemented. In old Pok√©mon, the equivalent of these mounts would be the HM, which, although annoying in their execution, provided a lot of exploration and backtracking, allowing constant revisits to previous areas where you could use these abilities to obtain rewards for exploring new areas. How is this handled here? We basically have 5 montures, which are Wyrdeer, Ursaluna, Basculegion, Snearsel, and Braviary. The first helps us to go through the areas faster, the second to track objects, the third to cross the waters, the fourth to climb walls and the fifth to plan in the air. The first two do not really provide any backtracking component, while the last three‚Ä¶ yes, but actually no. That is to say: among all the areas of the game, we only have 2 places to backtrack, which are an island in the first area and a cave in the third. The first can be accessed with Basculegion, while the second with Sneasler. The problem is that, in addition to such a little use for these mounts, whose use is more situational than anything else, once we get Braviary they become completely useless, if you have him, you will never need the others again. mounts, it is faster than Wyrdeer, you can go over walls without climbing them with Sneasler and the same with water.

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh, and he left me the incredible story of the game, at least with the one that delights us in the main story. I will be brief in this section because it really does not deserve my time. It turns out that after 15 hours of filling out the Pok√©dex, the sky turns red and the general of Team Galactic decides that it is the player's fault because he fell from a gap that appeared in the sky, by your face, without having shown doubts about you in all the game and without an event so important or dramatic as to justify this situation has really happened. Then it's your turn to stop the situation and for that you have to go look for the trio of the lakes so that they forge the red chain with which to stop Palkia and Dialga, the culprits of the situation. It turns out that two of the main characters of the game accompany you to the three lakes, but don't think that they are going to help you, this is not Pok√©mon Black and White: they are going to accompany you so that it seems that they are doing something, but if you remove them from there there wouldn't be any difference. So, in the end, you manage to forge red chains and you have to go to Spear Pillar, but not before fighting with the old man who makes every day your dinner and who suddenly, by the face, is a ninja who is the right hand of the general of Team Galactic‚Ä¶ What happened here? Well, the guy does everything possible so you don't stop the general -who wants to stop Dialga and Palkia by himself, but when you defeat him he asks you on his knees to stop the general. 10/10 writing. Later, you find the general, who is ready to stop the legendaries and you have to avoid it: then the guy admits that he was wrong to kick you out of the team but that he had no other choice because he had to do something, and challenges you to a fight according to which, if you win, you are right and he will apologize. So the fact of being defeated is what has made him understand that he is wrong?????????????? In Pok√©mon, things don't go like that. The thing is that if you defeat the enemy, then you are stronger and can do what you want, but they don't regret what they have done unless they are taught the lesson by other means. Maxie does not regret what he has done because you defeated him, he regrets it because he sees the disasters that his stupidity has caused. Yes, I'm using the Ruby and Sapphire story as an example of good writing, that's the story level of this game. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, you face one of the two legendary, you capture it but for x reason you can't catch the other. Then we go back to Jubilife Village and Daw‚Ä¶ I mean, Akari, uses the amazing Pok√©ball crafting skills that just got out of her ass to create the Convenience Ball to catch the other legendary. Character arc? What's that? Why would we do anything to complete this character's arc, which was how useless and weak she feels from not being a very good trainer? Nah, let's just take a comment made at the beginning of the game and get her to do Convenience Balls. Anyway, after this, they force you to put the legendary that you have captured in your team, return to Spear Pillar, and throw baits at the other legendary so that, automatically, without fighting or anything, the Pok√©mon is captured in a cutscene, without having used the other legendary for absolutely nothing, not even having fought: how ironic that you can't defeat the final boss by abusing baits when I just defeated all the bosses like that. And this way, with the weirdest and most anticlimactic ending in the series, the main quest ends.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that the postgame is extensive and has more plot, but‚Ä¶ Do you really think that after everything I have said I am going to dedicate 5 more minutes to this game? Do not be fooled by the fanboyism: the game is mediocre. It has to do with the fact that revolutionizing a formula is not a good thing in itself, but it depends on how the revolution is executed... And not many understand that. Is it different from the rest of the games in the main series? Yes. Is it necessarily better for it? No, it all depends on how that revolution is carried out, and the one we are dealing with is very lacking. Now we're going to call a masterpiece a mediocre game just for being different? Damn, then Pok√©mon Dash is also one of the best, as it is very different from the other games. Heck, and Adventure Between Keys? A unique and different experience. Please, let's use our brains: many exaggerate because of the fact that it is an open world, (or so they say, the reality is that it is semi-open). So what? An open or semi-open world is neither better nor worse than a linear game, it's just different: and I prefer a well-designed linear game to a poorly designed open-world like this Pok√©mon Legends. ‚ÄúThanks TPC and Game Freak, great, I hope this game is the top 1 in history, you deserve it and we deserve that you don't come down from here‚Äù. This is the level of demand. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I see a lot of people trying to defend the game because ""it's a base from which building future great games"". Do you know the problem? That what Game Freak always does are bases. Sun and Moon? A base. Let's Go ? Another base, Sword and Shield? Another base. Legends? Another base. Year after year they give us more and more bases and in the end no game ends up being really great, especially when these bases end up being wasted. It's possible that is not the case with Legends? Well, it is, but there are precedents to doubt that. I, for one, am not optimistic; you decide what to think.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,PLA is an amazing Mainline game with a handful of issues,"I keep seeing everyone not referring to PLA as a mainline game when you can find various sources that say it is a mainline game.

Anyway, besides that, I think Legends Arceus is an amazing game. I loved the gameplay, although repetitive, (a lot of pokemon games are though), is fun. I love how fast combat is, how much tougher pokemon is, The environment the game takes place in. It is really a great game that pushes new mechanics into the mainline series to give the series a breath of fresh air.

Though, We do need to talk about a huge issue. The graphics in the game aren't that good. The graphics feel like the game is meant to be on a GameCube. 

When you see some visuals in the game you can just see how bad they are, same 2D grass texture everywhere for bushes to hide in.. same grass texture for a lot of places actually. The water looks alright at best. The sky is amazing and fits the art style of the game great though. 

I believe GameFreak can improve more on this game if we be more vocal about it. Express that we do enjoy this kind of game, but wish to see it become even better, I just finished the story today and I really enjoyed the story. It was a little darker than other pokemon games that I played and I enjoyed that aspect of the game. 

Minor issue, I still really want more pokemon in this game.

I'll buy DLC for this game if they announce any (which is very possible cause they released DLC a few months after SwSh came out), but I hope to see them do better with it.

Edit: Also the fact they improved on animations compared to what SwSh had is awesome. Oh, and the fact that the battle area is just where you are in the world? Awesome!",CallOfDuty,neg

FIFA,I am ashamed to say this but I don't get along with TOTY Mbappe,"Ok, a little back story. I am very average Fifa player. I don't skill, at all. I just pass and try to play football. This year I managed to get to Elite division and hover around 1800 SR. I get my 11 wins in WL, managed to get to 14 once. Better results than last year but I still consider myself mediocre.

I considered my pack luck to be pretty bad so far. My best pull was Cordoba from the 1st hero pack as I ran a cheap Serie A team. Besides that my best pull was Pogba early on when he was worth something and prime van Basten (that was a cool pull but I prefer smaller agile players). I play quite a lot btw, WL and Div rivals every week. I had not seen Ronaldo, Neymar, Mbappe, Messi, Marquinhos, Kante, de Bruyne etc. at all.

So I opened up all my saved packs from TOTY (100+) and I got one good pull in Rudiger HM (he is absolutely amazing btw, highly recommend).

I was not planning on doing upgrade packs but on saturday I was bored and did a few. I did not realize the web app was bugged. I wanted to do PL upgrade packs but by accident I did 1 Ligue 1 upgrade pack. Imagine my shock when TOTY Mbappe showed up. I literally could not believe it as I thought I opened a PL pack.

Anyway, I feel like I do not deserve this card. When he gets on the ball you feel he is amazing, great speed and just blitzes past players.

But I tried him at ST, RF, CAM and he never seems to be available to receive a pass. I always find him surrounded by a crowd. Every game I play he seems anonymous and I almost forget he is on the field. On the other hand the Canadian R9 David (who is insanely cheap) outscores Mbappe for me (also recommend David highly).

I don't know why I posted this. It's just weird for a bad player like me used to cheap teams suddenly be handed the best player in game and not getting on with him.",CallOfDuty,neg

pokemon,"Balancing Team, a big Thank You!"," 

Pokemon as we all know and love for years now has changed quite a bit in the compeditive scene.

Powercreeps in Gen 5 and 7 tweaked the Meta into an faster and much harder hitting one. At the End of Gen 7 Megas and Z Moves rampaged throug Teams, regardless if a mon faced a check. The insanely diverse Sets of most Mons was very unpredictable, since the Movepools of most mons were so large.

For me personally, it was a bad direction in which we were heading. Everything outspeeding and oneshotting each other, left no room for tactical play whatsoever. it was really a Meta i wont miss at all.

With the Gen 8 announcement i thought to myself, how will they balance the Dynamaxing, Z Moves and Megas, but since Megas and Crystals are removed, and dynamaxing lasts only 3 turns (and is banned on showdown) i got my hopes up. And with a clever move they delivered.

They realized, that the biggest Problem in this Meta were the Movepools, so they reduced them significantly. That way even Mons that seem OP can be played in a way that doesnt feel broken or unbalanced.

A great example is Spectrier. Then Gen 8 Horse has the same ability as Magearna, increasing its SPA with every Knockdown. Unlike Magearna however it sits ad a solid 130 Speed. It is the recipy for a Sweeper, but unlike expectations it is quite manageable. And that is caused by its movepool. With Access to Shadowball and Dark Pulse it isnt able to sweep whole teams because it can be checked easily, dispite beeing quite strong.

Now it feels like the old Chess like Concept, that ive missed for years now since gen 4. Having Walls and Checks, Counters and sweepers, supports and leads. It feels like were finally playing real pokemon again. you cant just muscle through entire teams anymore, by brute force alone, but you have to build a well roundet team, that can react to different situations. And dont just be strong and fast.

The Devs managed to do this without nerfing the Power of any Pokemon, but by simple adjusting the Movepools, and for that i want to say a big Thank you and Well done. Altho Sword and Shield have their Flaws, and arent the best Pokemon Games, the Compeditive Field feels great!

Well Done.",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,Pok√©mon mounts,"In Scarlet and Violet we get to use Miraidon or Koraidon as a mount. With it we can be faster, fly, swim and probably more.

So, this is definitely better than having to use HMs and this easily beats the bike in Sword and Shield.

But for future games, I'd love to be more dependent on the actual Pok√©mon you have in your party.
I imagine, if you want to cross a body of water, any Pok√©mon able to swim and carry you can be used, but you actually have to have it in your party!

Want to be faster in foot? Just hop on one of your Pok√©mon! 

Same with other things like fly, dive, climb, etc.

That way the world itself would be a lot more of a challange  and feel way more immersive, and you'd be closer with your party. 

To add to that, I'd want to be able to send your pokemon to the PC at any time (you can do that with caught Pok√©mon if your party is full anyway, so why not being able to do it anytime with Pok√©mon in your party)

(not the other way around, though. You can only deposit Pok√©mon at a PC) 

That way you could catch a wild Pok√©mon for surf, fly etc, should you need one in a pinch.

So, what do you think? If Pok√©mon goes the open world route, the world is bound to get bigger and with all I mentioned, the world would feel so much more immersive.

assassinscreed,Idea for a Hidden ones DLC for AC Valhalla. Add some suggestions yourself,"Imagine this:  


Lore:

The Order of The Ancients where never truly destroyed. Powerfull leaders with Agents remain in the shadows.

Eivors Clan gets wiped out by the Order. He sees with his own eyes what the order does to innocents and those he loves. He finally understands the threat and finally commits to the Assassins. He and Hytham retreat to a Hidden ones Bureau and plans to take out the Order again.

In the end they find out that the Order has found a map for powerfull artifacts in Vinland. Eivor gets the map first, but there is other undiscovered maps  for Vinland out there. To make sure the Order doesnt get a foothold in Vinland, Eivor commits to Vinland and leaves Hytham in Charge of England. 

Eivor travels to Vinland and becomes the first Assassin to protect Vinland/America. He learns the Natives language and trains some of them up to become Assassins. In the end Eivor meets his end in Vinland, but leaves behind a new generation of Assassins.

Gameplay:

The DLC focuses on stealth. Missions are in Cities and big towns. 

Abilities:

""Odins noose"": Hang your enemies from trees and ledges, like the Allfather hanged himself from Ygdrasil. Ability is  similar to AC Rogue. 

""Berserker arrows"": Shoot an enemy with an arrow with special coating to make them enraged and attack anything in its way.

""Crows bite"" Throw a bag full of Silverwear and smelly food to attract a large number of crows to an area. Crows will distract enemies and will even harass them if they get to close. Small chance that crows will steal the enemies equipment. 

""The Voice of Loki"": Ravens can actually talk like parrots. Use Synin to distract an enemy from afar. Common Enemies like Swordsmen and Archers will be frightned and run away from the voice, while bigger enemies will go check it out. 

Skills: 

""Double Assassination"": Kill two people in the same Assassination animation.

CallOfDuty,[BO3] Question related to Steam versions of Black Ops 3.," TOO LONG DON'T READ: What version of Black Ops 3 to buy on Steam for Zombies?

&amp;#x200B;

Recently i've been getting back into Zombies again after running into a lot of free time. Started out on Plutonium World at War and played the Alpha for Black Ops 1 zombies. After roughly a month, i remembered black ops 3 had the commonly agreed best zombies mode out of any cod game released to date. Yesterday i checked and the game is 67% off on steam (As far as i know, COD games RARELY go on sale), but i couldn't figure one thing out. Which version of the game is the base game??

On steam, the game has 3 options for purchase. Multiplayer starter version (No bueno, includes only multiplayer and no zombies), Zombies Chronicles edition (I assume its only the DLC, but description says otherwise, still not sure) and Zombies Deluxe edition (Steam has no info on it). Which one of these is the base game? Is it truly the Zombies Chronicle Edition? As far as i know, the zombies chronicle edition was a DLC that added ALL old zombies maps back into Bo3.

The Ancient Trilogy tried something new, but even that new start has brought us to nothing. Even Valhallas ending wich wasn't bad felt more like a damage limitation and fan service.

I am so disappointed from Ubisoft that they don't care about the overall story of its biggest franchise. For me it was always a big reward when I end a AC Game and saw what the actions of the protagonist in the past contributed to the big story that connect every game. But sadly that is gone.

But when it comes to Pokemon Training, he just can't compete with people who take it more seriously and train more religiously. He's in it more for adventure and friendship, and I think that fits the role of Pokemon Ranger more.

pokemon,Drapion's size,"Ok, this is going to be a little long, it's something that was bumping my head for very much time and I think it could be an interesting point to discuss.

Some context, I saw Drapion for the first time like 11 years ago, during the battle between Ash and Paul in the Sinnoh League (I was 8 or 9 years old). In some point of the battle, Drapion grab Buizel with its tailpin, and it's this scene in particular where I remembered Drapion very, very larger than it actual size, Buizel was really small on its grabber's pin.

Years after, now with a lot more knowledge about the franchise, I decided to catch a Drapion on Platinum. I caught a Skorupi and evolved it. So, just as I was used to, I read the Drapion's entry, and found out something that really blow my head up. Drapion is actually 1,3m tall. That means a kid it's taller than a regular Drapion. Man, my nephew it's literally taller than it by 10cm, and she's 7 years old.

Then, faster than a speed boosted Ninjask, I research back for the scene of Paul's Drapion, trusting it was bigger than that. But I just realized that I was wrong. All this time, all these years, living a lie where Drapion is an humungous bloodlust beast, destroyed in two minutes of reserching on Wikidex and YouTube.

Now, I know I'm exaggerating a little, but on the time that fact was very shocking, even more considering the entries themselfs, which describes Drapion as a pokemon with the strengh to defeat rivals using nothing but brute force, and even crash a car. I don't wanna be judgemental, but do I really have to believe this dwarf can scratch a car, or even worst, crush it up? I don't think so.



This COULD have end there, just as another episode of things that make no sense on the franchise, BUT, searching more things about this pokemon lately (I really like Drapion, not gonna lie), I found a lot of interesting images, much of them from the manga, where, now for real, this pokemon's size is larger than the official one. Not only looking better actually, but also making sense on their descriptions and abilities.


Well, pretty much that. I know it's maybe a dumb observation, and that pokemon size are very inconsistent, but it's something that was bugging me and I would like to share it. Does Drapion have a proper official size or is better to make it bigger?",FIFA,pos

Sabrina was one of the earliest gym leaders we met on Ash's journey. She had the ability to transmute people into dolls, could teleport, could alter the size of people, read people's mind and could bend objects with her mind.

thesims,My Three Dark Crowns challenge,"I stumbled upon a book series called Three Dark Crowns a few years ago. It is a book series written by Kendare Blake.

The book series is about a fantasy medieval island were you have 5 different ""tribes"" living. All these tribes have a different power and culture. You have the poisoners, who are immune to all poisons and also very crafted in making antidotes. They like to eat/drink everything coated with poison. The natrualists are those who can control vegetation and have an animal companion. Elementalists can control the elements (shocker). War gifted are skilled warriors who can also control weapons to move on their own. Oracles can see the future in different ways; visions, tea reading, smoke patterns etc.

The island is always ruled by a queen. The queen is said to be a deity reincarnated. She will be married of to a prince from a foreign country to establish political allies. Due the magic of the island, the queen always gives birth to female triplets. The powers of the triplets are known at birth and the babies are shipped of to high ranking families of their corresponding tribes to be fostered there. The queen will leave the island after giving birth and never returns; a council rules in her place till a new queen rises.

The triplets get raised seperately and are never in contact with eachother. They are all trained in both politics and in their powers. When the girls turn 16, they have to kill eachother till one remains. They have to do that over the course of a year. If they do not succed, they get put into an arena till one remains.

The new queen rules the island till she gives birth to the next generation. This can be within a year after crowning or 20 years later.

Not every queen has as powerfull abilities as her sisters. One can be almost Avatar Aang like in elemental power, while the other can barely handle even the lightest of poisons.

When quadriplets are born, this is seen as sacred. The 4th baby will be the queen by default, the other babies will be killes off.

Now here is my challenge;

-Have a female spellcaster Sim. She is your starting queen. 

-make a palace like house.

-you can only pick one of the schools of magic to master in. Having two gifts is seens as an extremely bad omen in this universe. 

-pick two families in different worlds who will be the foster families. They will raise the babies. They do not have to be spellcasters themselves. I usally choose the Goths and the Landgraabs or the Charms.

-since the Sims 4 basegame only allows twins and triplets, use twins as the default number of babies that have to be born. If there are triplets, the 3th baby will be queen by default.

-the reigning queen must marry a non occult sim, from a world that is not the same as she is living in or one of the worlds that you choose for the foster families.

-when the twins turn into teens, they must fight who gets to live. Use your spellcaster abilities till one survives.

-make portrets or photos of your reigning queen and hang them to honor the previous queens. The girls who did not make it will have no immage of her.

-make a spooky pit like graveyard for the graves of all the girls who did not get to become queen. The ones who became queen you will delete the tombstone off or bury them somewhere else. Not at the palace.

-try to have the foster families be around for generations aswell.

-when the reigning queen has given birth, she must be stripped of her spellcaster status and never have other children again. She must leave the pallace and move with her husband to another world where neither she or the foster families are from and never contact her daughters again.

The only two things that I can think of are: a) Lucy was unsure of Desmond given he had run away from The Farm, and therefore didn't feel secure enough in divulging that she was an Assassin from the start or b) Lucy being a double agent was planned from the beginning and Vidic saving her life was meant to help set up a grey area of the how and why's of Lucy's various allegiances. I know the whole story of Partice saying he purposely killed of Lucy, but I don't have a compelling reason to believe Partice over just assuming the betrayal was somewhat planned from the start.

Tetris,[Tetrio] Why is there a lot less cheese at high level play?,"So I've noticed that over the past few months, the meta in SS has become mostly defensive, with most players either doing 2w-3w combos to send cheese, infinite downstacking (again to send cheese), or power stacking and following up their clean sends with short combos to cheese their opponents up. I'm in low U at the moment and it seems to have a better mix, but still has a good share of defensive players.

I'm curious, why is it that when I watch high level play I rarely see anyone using this playstyle? It seems to be effective enough to get people to U rank at least, but what aspect of high level play keeps players from using it at high levels? Is it just a matter of the pros having such high speed, high efficiency, really good downstacking skills that it becomes a non-issue for them?

EDIT: I ask because I'm trying to train to get good enough for X rank... I'd rather not waste time learning specific counters for this playstyle if I can instead get around it by just grinding my way to 2.5pps+ and 100+ APM in versus.",assassinscreed,pos

Sand Attack, Sand Tomb, Scorching Sands, and G-Max Sandblast are all Ground-type attacks. Sandshrew, Sandslash, Wormadam (Sandy Cloak), the Sandile line, Sandygast, Palossand, Silicobra, and Sandaconda are all Ground-type Pokemon. The Ground-type is best described as the type that encompasses dirt, clay, and *sand*.

Yet Sandstorm, the move that causes a whirlwind of sand to kick up, is a Rock-type move?? And the Sandstorm Weather that follows causes Weather Ball to turn into a Rock-type move, while also raising Rock-type Pokemons' special defense???

I do not understand it. It makes almost zero sense to not have Sandstorm be a Ground-type move and the Sandstorm Weather have Ground-based effects.",assassinscreed,neg

I'm not very good at knowing what I'm doing and didn't know if anyone could help? from what I can tell, I may need a mod by Treeag do 'edit in CAS', or maybe there's another mod I'm unaware of? or maybe just way to do it without mods, but that seems unlikely from what I can see.

Basically, my sims will now only wash 1 single dish at a time. If I try to click on the dishwasher to get them to load it, it says there are no dishes to wash on the lot, even if there are a dozen dirty glasses and plates. 

I've caught them occasionally still taking groups of dishes to wash, but it's inconsistent. I always check to make sure there are no hidden dirty dishes on shelves or half walls etc, but that's not the issue either. They'll still clean A dish, but the won't do ALL the dishes.

assassinscreed,[Spoilers] My experience with AC Unity and why I love the game.,"Thanks to the PS plus extra subscription, I was able to download and play Unity. Now I'm a big fan of Assassin's Creed and I like to watch videos of the franchise and I always had my eye on Unity, it's incredible graphics and especially the parkour. Due to this I know some spoilers (like Elise dying and Bellec's betrayal) about the story, but not all of them.

I just finished the mission where Arno is chasing Elise, (who I simp) who is on a hot air balloon. After finishing the incredible and fun mission I can safely say that Unity is one of the most fun (and frustratingly challenging) games I've played in a long time.

The biggest reason I wanted to play Unity was for the parkour, and it does not disappoint. Having played most of the AC games, this game's parkour is one of the most complex I have seen. The Free Run Down button is just pure bliss, seeing how Arno can quickly climb down a building if amazing. Learning new parkour moves, and mastering how to execute them is just a great time. Of course there is still the janky parto of franchise's parkour, where Arno jumps in the wrong direction and suddenly stops climbing, but when you get the parkour to work, it's just fantastic. It's incredible how Ubisoft completely dropped this feature for future games! Just imagine the complex parkour with the ability to climb anything like in Origins or Valhala.

The atmosphere of the game is just amazing. Now I'm a casual player and whenever I hear a critic praise or criticize ""atmosphere "", I roll my eyes, never really getting what they were saying. Now I do. Every corner in the game is filled with a bunch of NPCs doing diverse things, like painting, sewing some clothes, dragging someone to their death. Then you enter a cafe and the people are cheering and singing, the game is just full of life.

Now the story, it's quite enjoyable but you can clearly see that the game was rushed (apart from the controversial bugs years ago of course). Arno was really charming at the beginning of the game, but after joining the Assassins he loses some of that charm and wittiness. It's still there but you have to pay very close attention. Also after Arno escapes the prison and finds Elise, he tries to explain Elise about the assassins and the templars and she is all like ""Oh yeah I've known about that all along"". It seemed very anti climatic. Elise definitely needed more development the game wants you to think that she is this big templar member, like when you bring her to the assassin's base, everyone get angry and wary of her like she is this big shot of the templars, but we haven't seen her do much of anything at this point. Finally, another evidence of how rushed this game was ( or badly written) is Bellec. At the start the game makes you think he will be this charming and rough old mentor for Arno, but after joining the assassin's he just disappears and is only relevant until that moment.

Overall, the game is a great time to play after all the updates fixing the major bugs. I wish executives at Ubisoft could've gave Unity more time to develop, it could've have been a game of the year. Now that it's free with the PS Plus subscription, I highly recommend playing through this game.

Also for some reason, Unity with it's incredible graphics, it still doesn't make my PS4's fan activate like a turbine while God of War makes my PS4 fly up into the heavens.",FIFA,pos

thesims,A Sim Lover's Tale of Woe...Widowed After Only 1 Hour,"Be warned...this is a sim tale of woe...and a warning to all sim lovers out there. Be careful when crafting sim love stories...sometimes, they unexpectedly lead to tragic ends. The other day, I decided to make my plant sim (yes, I'm doing that scenario) fall in love with a townie, Kado Akiyama. It was a beautiful romance. Then one day, Kado called my plant sim for a date at the caf√©. I had them fall deeper in love, and they quickly became engaged.

To celebrate, they consummated their love in a nearby bush. Elated, they went back in the caf√© and on a whim, decided to elope. They got married right then and there, witnessed by the random sims dining at the caf√©. All seemed right with the world, as the newlyweds kissed as husband and plant wife for the fist time.

However, their happy union was not meant to last. A short while after the ceremony, suddenly, a warning message pops up for Kado, saying something about him being hysterically happy and needing to calm down. So I sent him to the bathroom and had him start to calm down in the mirror....but I was too late. Before I knew it, he collapsed to the ground...dead. He died of happiness in the caf√© bathroom. Literally.

As Death approached his body, my plant sim plead and begged Death to spare her new groom. She even flirted with him. But, he rejected her pleas, and took Kado's soul, much to the horror of Kado's new wife and the caf√© diners. The sweet newly weds had only been married for about a sim hour...what a tragic, short lived union. My plant sim wife was now a widow. A day that should have been filled with tears of joy, were now filled with tears of sadness.

Kado's grave now rests on the property of the house they would have shared, with the epitaph ""My husband of 1 hour."" One night, his ghost came to visit her. They shared one last woohoo, as a final farewell. In the morning he returned to his grave, vanishing in the morning light....

Now, my plant sim only dwells with the plants and nature...gardening by day, and mourning lost soul mate by night. She will never love again.

Hello I‚Äôm looking for recommendations on replacement batteries for my game boy advanced sp and my Pok√©mon yellow pikachu edition, Pok√©mon blue and Pok√©mon gold. All the old big cartridges. I found some on Amazon but wanted to double check here. 

I have the tools to remove the backing of the cartridges but do I really need to solder? Is there anything else I need to know or be cautious of?

Also the blue and gold saves have unfortunately disappeared but the yellow is still there. I‚Äôll be asking about emulators and uploading saves in the future lol

Thank you in advance!",legostarwars,neg

Saw that she was hungry so I went to make food, she hates cooking so became tense, then the kitchen caught on fire, went down to 500 simoleons, became sad because lack of social, tried to call friends to hang out but they were sleeping, failed the audition, said fuck it, quit acting, became a doctor, motherloded and moved into an apartment. Now she is a Medical Assistant but I'm struggling with the social because of how hard it is to keep your work effectiveness up as a doctor (Need to do 1,000,000 tasks for bronze, may or may not be exaggerating.) so I don't get demoted.

FIFA,Quick Futties Hakimi Review,"Did his SBC because I have a lot of PSG/Ligue 1 cards now, and he fits that RW position in the formation for chemistry perfectly. Used him as a RM/RWB in a 352 in-game with Guardian chemistry to boost his balance and defense.

**Initial impressions**: Excellent card. More details below.

**Pace**: 10/10 - Rapid and fast. One of the fastest cards I've used in the RM position all year.

**Shooting**: 9/10 - Pretty good finishing and 4\* WF. Only downside is that he's not one of those cards where you can pick the corners from sharp angles with him, which is a scenario that pops up pretty often as a RM.

**Dribbling**: 9.5/10 - Pretty damn responsive on the ball, and with Guardian chemistry his balance is noticeable. His 89 agility feels like it's much higher in game for some reason. Cuts in from the right wing really well, even with LS dribbling only.

**Passing**: 9/10 - Does the job fine like most post-TOTS cards. Nothing spectacular, but can make all the types of passes well.

**Defense**: 9.5/10 - Runs back and tackles really well for his attributes.

**Physical**: 9.5/10 - Surprisingly strong considering his attributes. Maybe it's because he's pretty tall combined with a lean body type. Holds off defenders when running down the wing too.

**Best part of the card**: His AI. This is one of the ""smartest"" RM/RWB cards I've used this year. Makes crazy good automatic runs on offense. Aggressive too, makes lots of runs and then resets and makes another run if you recycle the ball. Defensively he's usually in pretty good position too. For reference, when I ran 97 Kimmich in the same position, he wasn't nearly as good with his runs or his tracking back.

**Price**: For one 85 squad this is crazy good value. I think it's a better card than Di Maria for a fraction of the price. It's pretty easy to link at this stage of the game too. Paredes + Atal and he's already on 10 chem.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Is it just me? ORAS is generic and soulless compared to the original RSE,"Does anybody else else share this sentiment? Just got the meteorite in AS.

Love RSE, but ORAS feels incredibly generic and soulless. The visuals in particular, whilst they're impressive for a Pok√©mon game, as a JRPG, I actually think it's quite poor, it could honestly be any game. The sprite-based original still looks great. Also think the music isn't quite as good as other entries, which are usually fantastic. I love the music in the original though.

I'm particularly surprised as I didn't expect to like USUM as much as I did. I think I actually rate X and Y better than ORAS, despite XY having the worst post-game, IMO.

GSC are my favourite, and I thoroughly enjoyed HGSS. You simply can't beat being able to go to Kanto. Post-game is my favourite by a long way.

ORAS seems to lack drama and impact. Stuff happens and I feel zero about it. There's moments of brilliance in terms of camera angles and map design, but they're inconsistent. USUM by comparison at least felt more engaging. Expected far more.",pokemon,pos

pokemon,I think that TPC should redub the First Movie,"So I've recently posted about how poor the 4kids dub for ""Mewtwo strikes back"" is, because of how much errors it has and how it messed up the story, and I've been thinking : would it be a good idea for the Pok√©mon Company to create an alternate dub for the movie? It would be completely faithful to the original without butchering the plot or the characters, it would include the birth of mewtwo short that was cut out of the 4kids release, and no abysmal dubbing errors. And like I said, it would not alter the plot from the original, meaning that it would follow the existential themes from the original and NOT have that cringey hypocritical message of ""Pok√©mon fighting is wrong"", and mewtwo's character would be intact, unlike how it was from the 4kids dub. The only concern is the voice acting and how it won't be the same cast as the previous dub. But besides that, I think TPC can pull it off. I just don't want the only English dub of the first movie to be that bowlderized mess (no offense to those who actually like the 4kids dub)",thesims,pos

assassinscreed,Which AC games are the best when it comes to post-game replayability? Which AC games do you wish had more post-game replayability?,"Once you finish the main story, you'll probably want to do some more side-activities or replay previous quests/missions to get the most out of the game. It also gives you more bang for your buck because you won't have to spend additional cash to purchase DLCs just for the sake of having something to do. There were some AC games which I loved but I can't play them too often because there isn't much to do anymore. For example, AC II was an excellent game but it really bums me out that I can't replay the main memories. I also loved AC Unity but it sucks that I can't replay the Paris Stories and Cafe Theatre missions. These games were great but there were times when I felt like there was nothing left to do in the game.

Which AC games are the best for me in terms of post-game replayability?

1. Odyssey - it basically never ends. Enemies respawn in all the forts and regions constantly switch between Athenian and Spartan Control. Nation leaders also respawn whenever an area changes leadership. The number of forts, quarries, and military outposts in Odyssey is insane and you can just clear them out over and over again for fun.
2. Valhalla - River Raids never end because foreign supplies always respawn. Guards also constantly respawn in Monasteries throughout England even if you've already pillaged the supplies. There are a lot of Monasteries throughout the map and it's really fun to just test yourself by clearing them out.
3. Syndicate - You can replay almost everything in this game. Main memories, side memories, child liberations, templar hunts, kidnapping activities, you name it.
4. Origins - Pretty much the same as Odyssey and Valhalla. Guards respawn in all forts and outposts. However, I found the number of major forts to be far less than that of Odyssey and Valhalla. I guess this is because of Origins having several unpopulated areas in the map. The Discovery Tour of AC Origins more than makes up for it though. It's an excellent way to learn more about ancient Egypt.

&amp;#x200B;

Which AC games would I like to have more post-game replayability?

1. AC II - This game is excellent but it's a huge bummer that I can't replay the main memories. Some of the best missions in the entire series are main memories in AC II. Thankfully this was fixed in Brotherhood and Revelations.
2. Unity - Paris Stories, Social Club missions, and Cafe Theatre missions are excellent. I wish I could replay them
3. Black Flag &amp; Rogue - I really loved both of these games. However, legendary ships don't respawn. Assassination Contracts in Black Flag and Gang Headquarters in Rogue don't reset either. This leaves hardly any land-based activities where you can test out your stealth. The only way you can test out your abilities on land is to clear out warehouses and outposts. I wish Assassination Contracts and Gang Headquarters could be reset.",GTA,neg

**Iscan** 

Iscan seems to be a tricky person for everyone to pick up on. So I'm going to breakdown what features he has and who I believe his descendant is.

Iscans Features:

* Raised Eyebrows that droop to the side
* Silverish blue eyes
* Blue purple hair
* A cat mouth 
* A golden bracelet 
* An association with ghosts

When you list it all like this its obvious.

**Iscan's descendant is Acerola!**

Now.. I know what you are thinking, ""OP That doesn't even make sense why did they turn Acerola into a black man LOL"" but when you think about it his Love interest isn't black so his descendant could look like anything. When you meet Iscan there is a delay before you see his face and his cat mouth and eyes are supposed to be the dead giveaway. If this isnt intended by Gamefreak I would be suprised.

pokemon,I need to vent about mega evolution,"IT MAKES NO SENSE, how would putting a soul in a rock cause a Pokemon to evolve!? And how do ghost type Pokemon evolve if THEY ARE THE SOUL, is there a Gengar trapped in a gengarite? Cause thats literally what it's emplying, if you broke a gengarite would you free the Gengar trapped inside?
How did it even get trapped in there?! What about dusknoir? Could a dusknoir steal any Pokemons soul and trap it in a rock and now that Pokemon can mega evolve?! IS SPIRITOMB A MEGA STONE?! cause, THATS WHAT THE LORE IS IMPLYING. again, how did the souls even get trapped in rocks? How does a human even build A WEAPON THAT MAKES YOU IMMORTAL AND CREATES AN ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE?!? Let's look at the other gimics, z stones? There just concentrated forms of infinity energy, gmax? Radiation from a space dragon that makes you giant, Pokemon was based off of Kaiju anyways, mega evolution? Souls trapped in rocks turn cause a Pokemon to go super Saiyan with the power of friend ship?!

pokemon,A thread about why I think the starters on Arceus look like that (SPOILERS),"Hello! 

Of course, as the title says, spoilers ahead. No images but text spoilers.

So I was thinking about the starters, and why are they so close to their normal counterparts. And I think that the main reason is because of the pre-evolution. GF seems to have wanted to keep the whole line the same except for the last evolution, so the last evolution has to look very similar to the normal one.

But now lets try to imagine a little bit.

Thyplosion is trying to look like a yokai, right? Imagine how could it have looked if they actually wanted it to like one. Because this Thyplosion does not look like a yokai at all, but if already cyndaquil was ghostlike? Marowak style but yokai-ish. I think it could have looked soooo good.

Decidueye, its a clear samurai. Imagine if they had went more with it since the first evolution, maybe he could have had a ""sword"" like farfetch'd, like a stick. 

Samurott I am not sure what they were trying to do this time. Samurott is already based on a samurai right? Is he one here also, like decidueye? But then why is he dark type? This is the only one I cannot identify what they were trying to change. 

I especially think that Thyplosion could have looked really good, look like an actual ghost, more exaggerated since yokai are usually that. I dont know but the toon dragon of yu gi oh came to my mind as a similar style they could have used in the yokai.

People said that they couldn't change them much because they are marketeable, but I think that they would have been more liked if they went with it. Like you can see its cyndaquil, but it is already a ghost? Wow.

My love for The Sims really kicked off when the TS2 came out. I‚Äôve moved up with all of the games, but none of them beat 2, IMO (Of course it could use a revamp or something, since it‚Äôs so outdated now). 
I‚Äôm about to buy a new gaming laptop. I have all of the games on discs including TS2 and all of the expansions. I‚Äôve heard that most computers won‚Äôt run TS2 nowadays, without some other software downloaded as well.? 
Is that even accurate? 
I‚Äôm not a computer whiz, but I‚Äôm also not tech illiterate, so if someone could please explain to me what all I need to do to get optimal Sims2 play, I would greatly appreciate it! 
Also, i keep seeing screen shots of people‚Äôs Sims2 looking nearly as smooth and beautiful as 4, so if anyone wants to drop some specific mods you‚Äôd recommend, I‚Äôd appreciate that so much!

I‚Äôve put so many hours into this household, mourned so many Sims.. got so attached to these wonderful little creatures I had created with such attention to detail.... and I‚Äôve stupidly just saved over it with another Let‚Äôs play. I was on my 5th and 6th generations. They‚Äôre all gone. 
I had to close the game and come here, I honestly feel so gutted.
I haven‚Äôt backed the family up to the gallery in months so even though all is not lost.. SO MUCH IS GONE :‚Äô(

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm more angry or heartbroken - angry at myself for not being more careful (or backing up my files) OR heartbroken that I didn‚Äôt save the latest Heir to my gallery.

You are supposed to face the defender and be behind the ball like real life. You are supposed mark passing lanes, switch to the correct player in anticipation of a pass and jockey/defend at the same time with L2 and R2.

I was watching one very very well known FIFA YouTuber who is pretty good, but they were blaming animations and poor positioning by the AI for their poor defending‚Ä¶ it was amusing to say the least. 

So many people just run alongside the attacker and attempt to tackle from behind or from the side, they don‚Äôt switch players in anticipation of the opponents next move, or they just don‚Äôt pay attention then they get successfully countered, blame the game and then ragequit.",pokemon,pos

This one is hard, because my favorite first pre-evo starter form is Tepig, favorite middle starter form is Dewott, and favorite fully evolved starter form is Serperior. So I‚Äôd say I like all starters in Gen 5.

I hope that they at least have the metal damage counters ~~and coin~~.

We see in the Fields of Elysium simulation that Persephone threw Hermes off a cliff or whatever but we don't know if he survived. What if he did end up surviving and became the Isu that we know to be Loki. I mean it's a stretch but hear me out when he ""fell"" Havi saved him and Hermes told him that he was Loki to hide that he was from a different Isu group. Then while he was having all these new adventures with Havi's group he met and fell in love with Aletheia/Angrboda which was when he created his staff. Then he gifted his staff to her which she used to sink Atlantis but in doing so almost killed herself. Loki with the staff actually saved her so that he would pass it along to his descendant Pythagoras who would pass it along to the Keeper of the Staff who would pass it to ""The Heir of Memories"" who would then go into the Yggdrasil Machine which would reunite/revive Loki(Basim) and Aletheia.",assassinscreed,neg

pokemon,I kept waiting for Oricorio to learn an elemental move. I was disappointed.,"Oricorio was one of my favorite new designs in gen 7. A bird that changes form &amp; type depending on island/nectar?? What a cool idea!! Surely this will give me some cool type coverage on my team. I wonder what moves it can learn under each type?? 

Oh.. it only learns flying type moves &amp; very limited TMs... 

Oh but okay it has a special move called Revelation Dance!! The move changes types depending on which form of Oricorio you have. There it is! But, oh.. it learns that move at lv 40, so much further into the story than my lv 16 Oricorio I picked up from the first island... 

I remember being so disappointed I boxed mine &amp; never picked it back up. Post game I bred one with Revelation Dance as a lv 1 move from both parents. So if I played the game again I could actually use it's special move earlier in the game. 

I never did replay the game though, so I never used it. 

I am especially disappointed because Rotom's moves change the second you change it's form. I wonder why Oricorio didn't get the same consideration.

For example, I'd add levitation to Magnezone, given that it's a pokemon that due to his concept literally levitates, it doesn't make sense that it can receive a Earthquake (with 4x damage btw).",FIFA,pos

FIFA,Quick and bad isak tots review!,"Edit: Apologies om the misleading title, I meant it asin I whacked this together in like 10 mins and it isn't a very good review but hes an amazing card!

Beinghow good his future stars was, as soon as I saw this card I knew I had to try it as he fits my play style perfectly. I unlocked him last night with relative ease (took me around 2, 2 and a half hours) and went to bed. This morning I got on, played around with fitting him into my team and I came up with [this](https://imgur.com/a/V7mfpEh) 

I have played 8 games with him so far in fut champs, winning 7 and losing 1 and he has 12 goals and 10 assists, almost all from crosses and some from him powering through the defenders and either scoring or setting up a rebound for another attacker. Personally I think his pace is not as high as it says on the card but his shooting, 5 star weak foot and everything else is incredible. Added with his 6 foot 4 frame, he rarely loses a header. His fraught s are not brilliant (only the outside foot shot) but that doesn‚Äôt much matter with how he should be used because he doesn‚Äôt need to finesses or agile dribble because he has plenty enough power and strength to barge through defenders and smash it near or far corner. 

Thanks for reading this far and if you want me to try writing any other reviews about players I have on my bench or anyone tradeable under 500k on xbox I‚Äôll do my best :)",pokemon,pos

pokemon,"Thinking of fake signature Pok√©mon moves, day 199: Metang and Metagross","I am coming up with at least 1 fake move that would be exclusive to 1 Pok√©mon or an evolutionary line of Pok√©mon. I am going in Pok√©dex order, and I will skip every Pok√©mon or evolutionary line that already has a Pok√©mon in it that has a signature move. Signature Z-moves or G-Max moves don't count. Also, I don't make moves for Pok√©mon to make them better in battle. While it may make them more usable, that is not my intent most of the time, I just make moves to give the Pok√©mon something they need, deserve or are said they can do, but aren't able to do with their current movesets. 

The move for Metang and Metagross is called Metal Break, a Steel-Type Physical move with 65 base power and 15 PP. The base power of the move doubles when the target's HP is at or below 50% HP. The move was pretty much entirely thought of by u/TheLego27.

The idea of this move is that it is basically a Physical Steel-Type variant of the move Brine. Giving this move to Metang and Metagross might make it seem a little obsolete, and maybe it is, but I think it'd work quite well regardless. It certainly is a lot better than my original idea for these Pok√©mon, namely a generic recoil move to fall in line with Salamence's move from yesterday. 

The move is performed by the user slamming, punching or in another way physically attacking the target. If the target's HP is at or below half of the total amount, Metal Break gets twice as powerful to make sure the target will get KO'd. 

Beldum doesn't get this move because... it's whole thing is kind of that it only has Take Down until it evolves.... I'm not sure why that is but it is. So I didn't wanna mess with that. 

For the rest, there isn't much more to it. It's mainly just a strong smack with a metal arm. I don't think it should count as a punch or something, like Meteor Mash, I feel like it would fit this move better if the attack happened with the side of the arm rather than the front of it, if you know what I mean. This way it can still deal a lot of damage (especially if the target is weakened) while not being as powerful as a punch like Bullet Punch (yes I know it has lower base power) or Meteor Mash.

I'd love to hear feedback or questions about my ideas, and if you have any ideas for signature moves for Pok√©mon, I'd love to hear them, I might use the ideas (with your consent of course)! Even though this is a daily thing, or at least, I'll try to keep it daily, I don't think I'll be consistent with the time of day I post another idea.",FIFA,pos

FIFA,FUT Web app: info for a PC player moving to XBOX. How does it work?,"Hello! I'm a returning FIFA player, i used to play on PC and i played there last year as well. Some days ago i decided to pick up a console and I'm now interested in making my  XBOX my platform of choice for FIFA.

I just saw that the web app launched earlier today, so i was wondering: if i were to access the FIFA 23 web app right now, how can I make it so that the game I'll access through that and team I'll build on there will be the one that will belong to my XBOX version of the game, and not the PC one? Because when i try to log in it says ""PC"" in the top-right corner of the screen (i didn't go past the ""welcome back"" screen just in case it would screw something over) 

I don't think the teams are shared between PC and XBOX (i might be wrong tho) but the login on the website is still only through the EA account, so that's why I'm pretty confused. I saw that you can login with your XBOX account too, but the end result is the same since my XBOX and EA accounts are connected.

The answer is probably something really obvious, but i can't figure it out and I can't find anything online either. If anybody went through the same process and could help, that'd be great! Thanks and good luck with your packs üôèüèº",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,"S/V is, so far, a fine experience.","I was really, really reluctant after the reviews I heard, but decided to get it anyways, as I had some birthday money on me, so why not. I didn't have many performance issues at all, in fact, I've only had 2, thsoe being in the intro. (At one point, 2 NPCs T-posed for a few seconds. My right arm also blinked in and out of existence after talking to Nemona after our first battle) but otherwise? Nothing, zero, nada. So, I found the game to be really good, honestly. I still think Legends Arceus beats it in both quality and the fun factor, but Violet is really fine, really enjoyable.

 Character customization is great, letting you change eye/mouth shape, and even letting you pick typically opposite gender hairstyles, which I think is a first for the franchise. 

The game's open world is great, and the amount of pok√©mon you can get as soon as the game starts is incredible (although some pok√©mon are locked behind areas that gotta be unlockes through the Starfall quest, like Tropius)

The picnic system is also great, ballin' with your pok√©mons has never been cooler.

And again, the technical issues aren't really present in my game, and I wonder why they're so prevalent in others' (I play on the Switch improved rerelease, whatever it's called).

Game is a solid 7.895/10, slightly better than SwSh but worse than Legends Arceus, it's a perfectly enjoyable (if it's not breaking apart, which mine isn't).",assassinscreed,pos
GTA,Meaning of 171,"Meaning of 171
 What is 171:

 171 is a code that refers to article 171 of the Brazilian Penal Code, referring to the act of embezzlement, that is, deceiving other people to obtain one's own benefits.

 Due to the content related to article 171 of the Penal Code, this code was popularly used as slang.

 When someone calls a person who 171, he means that this individual is a liar, bad character and unreliable.

 This slang is widely used among criminals themselves, when they accuse people who belong to their groups or gangs of not being trustworthy.

 Thus, a ‚Äú171 person‚Äù is seen as a taker, who uses communication skills and sympathy only to achieve his own goal, regardless of the physical or emotional conditions of others.

 According to the text provided for in article 171 of the Penal Code, it is classified as embezzlement in the case of: ‚Äúobtaining, for oneself or for others, an unlawful advantage, to the detriment of others, inducing or keeping someone in error, through artifice, ruse, or any other fraudulent means‚Äù.

 The penalty for this crime is from 1 (one) to 5 (five) years of imprisonment, plus the payment of a fine.",pokemon,pos

I went back for Klawf so I could have it with a titan mark, but I just checked her and compared her to the normal one I caught and neither of them had anything? That was expected from the second one, but the one that was the former titan I thought was supposed to have a mark? Did I mess up somehow or is the mark still rare even if it's the one you have to talk to to fight it?

Day 095: Onix!

Onix is actually really cool. At first I was about to be like; ""It's just a snake rock"" but like

Being a snake rock is kind of metal? (but not literally since this line doesn't get that until way later)

Admittedly with it being gen 1 this is a pretty good design. I think it's interesting and given it was Brock's ace it was pretty relevant in the show. It was a powerful force to be reckoned with.

I'll always be reminded of a post I read awhile ago about a mother that searched *everywhere* for an Onix plush for her daughter. It reminded me that every pokemon is truly somebody's favorite. I really hope that mom found merch of Onix for her daughter &lt;3

I think I'll always be a little peeved that Onix didn't take on a silver color for its shiny since it was made into a pretty big deal in the show. I don't have Onix's shiny that much but I kind of wish it was more of a bright gold rather than this sickly green gold it got. I still don't think it's horrible. I just wish it was better blep

Overall I think Onix goes in the **C+** rank. It was a standalone pokemon for a long time and did *well*. I like it enough uwu

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you enjoyed my rambliings! Let me know what you think of Onix, I'd love to hear it!

See ya tomorrow\~

FIFA,How I adapted to make the new gameplay a little more bearable.,"Like many in the sub I was very disappointed by the changes made in the latest update. During last week I really struggled in divisions, but after changing up my tactics I had quite a decent time during the Weekend League. Here are just some things that I helped me:

-Don‚Äôt play with direct passing in tactics. I found that playing on possession makes your attackers start a little deeper, and forces the opposition defence a bit further up the pitch leaving a bit more space for you to attack. 

-You NEED attackers with at least 4 STAR WEAK FOOT. Being more versatile and exploiting both sides of defenders by sometimes going for shots with a players weaker foot makes you a way less predictable opponent. I can‚Äôt tell you how many goals I scored by people expecting me to get the ball onto Lukaku‚Äôs left foot.

-Keep a little distance from the ball carrier when defending deep near the box. It is often better to position your player for a block, rather than going for a tackle. If you tackle the ball it often bounces back to the opposition and your defence is wide open. 

-If you struggle a bit with defending don‚Äôt go for a defensive tactic. It‚Äôs better to start with improving your attacking, as even high level players often concede multiple goals every game. You have more control in your attacking play, so improving that should be your first goal.

-Explosive players are not as overpowered as people claim. Lengthy players can still be good, but you should limit yourself to one lengthy attacker as you need agile players around to give you more options in possession and an easier time with trying to keep the ball.

-Understand that even if you concede and go a couple of goals behind that the game isn‚Äôt over. I had multiple where I lost a big lead, and  some where I came back from a few goals behind. Some games can even be 10 goals+

-Make sure your striker has high attacking work rate. With Medium they don‚Äôt find good positions inside the box and you almost have to constantly search for them. I experienced this with WC hero Donovan who‚Äôs got amazing stats, but terrible AI.

-Look over your defensive players and make sure that their aggression stat is at least over 80. In my experience players who lack aggression often don‚Äôt commit the way you want when tackling. My Rijkaard improved massively when I switched from a shadow to Anchor on him.

-Don‚Äôt get too angry. Every loss is a learning experience, and the best way to improve is to not blame the game and try to look at what you can do better. Most of us suck at this game anyway.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,"If pokemon lived in the real world, where would they live, part 4. Dragon types, and some others from SV","I know it has been awhile since the last part, but I‚Äôm back for another round. This time I‚Äôm covering the dragon type. As well as all of the ghost, poison, and ground types introduced in scarlett and violet. So let‚Äôs start with the dragons.


Ocean dwellers: let‚Äôs just get the easy ones out of the way the dragons that would just live in the ocean. Those would be kingdra, dragalgie, dracovish and that‚Äôs it. 


So usually I devide these up into categories but this time I‚Äôm just going to go through the pokemon one by one


Dratini line: it says in the pokedex that these pokemon live in freshwaters, are rarely found, and like waterfalls, that doesn‚Äôt quite narrow things down at all as there are remote waterfalls all around the world, but one of the top results based on this criteria is sutherland falls New Zeland, so I guess these guys are kiwis now


Alola exeggutor: palm trees are everywhere in the tropics, however the tallest palm trees grow in columbia


Altaria (and swablu): so how do I rate cloud pokemon geographically? I guess I could go with the country that gets the most rainfall, which would be new guinea, and considering the large amounts of avian life there, that sounds pretty accurate


The shelgon line (and roaring moon): the shelgon line most closely resembles a european dragon, so I‚Äôm sure that the salamence line would be all over europe


The axew line: where do I even start with these? These pokemon have axes for faces, and are giant reptiles. The strongest tree in the world is an australian ironwood species, so perhaps these guys would be testing their blade sharpness in the land down under


Druddigon: druddigon is based on a species of lizard native to Africa, so it makes sense that it would be found there


The deino line: so hydragon is based on greek myth, but their names are inspired by the german words for one two and three. So I guess their range would go from Germany to Greece, or perhaps iron jugulis would be in germany while hydragon proper would be in Greece, and the prevolutions would be spread out through the rest of that range


Tyrunt and tyrantrum: US and Canada, just like where their fossils are found


The goomy line: what do I do about‚Ä¶goo dragons. I‚Äôd gay that the normal goomy line would be at home in the amazon, with it being the biggest rainforest and it having a massive river running through it. Meanwhile the hissuian variants would be more at home in the mineral rich DRC


Noibat and noivern: they‚Äôre bsed on wyverns, which are a european species of dragon


Turtonator: while it is based on the matamata turtle it acts nothing like it. I‚Äôd assume it would be at home near volcanoes, perhaps yellowstone park would suit its fancy


Drampa: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch my child or I‚Äôll fukin kill you‚Äù sounds pretty american to me


The jangmo-o line: they‚Äôre very wrapped up in hawaiian mythology, so hawaii


Guzzlord: this thing would end the world if it was real, I think humanity would try to contain it or hunt it to extinction


Applin line: wild apple trees can be found throughout the New Englad area of the US, so it only makes sense for these three to find their home around that area


Dracozolt: I can imagine these guys running through the african savannah, I guess they kinda give ostrich vibes to me


Duraludon: england, it‚Äôs G-max form is based on the largest building in england


The baxcalibur line: arctibax‚Äôs name made this one easy. These three would be the guardians of the north pole


Tatsugiri: these guys are very closely related to dondozo, not literally I mean they have a symbiotic relationship. And as far as I‚Äôm aware, they‚Äôre both very japanese in origin, so Japan feels like a safe bet


Cyclizar: these guys would be common in the netherlands, as they have the largest number of cyclists to make use of them


Okay that‚Äôs it for the dragon types, now onto the ghost, ground, and poison types from gen 9


Paldean wooper and clodsire: quagsire (and I believe clodsire as well) are based on giant salamanders, in the ground type one I put quagsire in Japan so it makes sense to the more polluted counterparts to live in the more polluted area where these creatures can be found in, China


Varoom and revavroom: since I put cyclizar in the netherlands because of it‚Äôs bike usage, I‚Äôm putting these two in the US, since we have the highest car usage in the world


Glimmer and glimmora: I have no clue. Their designs and dex entries don‚Äôt give me much to work with, they like caves I know that much. The deepest cave in the world can be found in Georgia (the country) so if any place can support a sizable population of these little guys, it‚Äôs Georgia


Shroodle and grafaiai: madagascar, Grafaiai is based on an animal that lives exclusively on madagascar. 


Iron moth: the pokedex mentions that this thing is extraterrestrial, so‚Ä¶.fuck if I know. The US has the highest amount of UFO sightings so I guess the US makes the most sense


Skeledirge (and its prevolutions): skeledirge is a crocodile and it has a bird on its nose. The only bird that cleans crocodile teeth can be found in Egypt. So‚Ä¶ Egypt it is for this lot


Gravard and houndstone: tombstones are a common method of remembering somebody in Europe and America, however in Europe the remains are often moved after a set time, whereas in America they linger a bit longer, so I‚Äôll say these guys would like the US more, as they wouldn‚Äôt be interrupted as often


Gimminghoul and goldengo: thresure chests were invented in Ancient Egypt, so its likely thats where these guys first found their home, although the roamers would likely be more comfey in more financially rich areas


Flutter mane: I mentioned in the ghost episode that misdreavus and mismagius would be at home in france and I‚Äôm willing to buy flutter mane would be the same


The charcadet line: I don‚Äôt think these three are legendaries so I think I can cover them. They‚Äôre knights but that just puts them‚Ä¶well anywhere in Europe, perhaps it could be an east/west thing, like aramarouge is from the west and crueledge is from the east


Annihilape (and by extension primape and mankey): the most aggressive (non human) ape is the chimpanzee, and I feel like its fitting for these guys to fit the same bill, so the jungles of africa will be their home


Great tusk: I‚Äôm starting to think that we won‚Äôt be getting an elephant pokemon that captures the majesty of the real life animal. And if that is the case, great tusk will be our african elephant stand in


Sandy sparks: magnesium was first found in Greece, so I say that sandy sparks would originate from there


Iron treads: it feels like an animal humans would make after elephants were banned from circuses to replace them‚Ä¶that doesn‚Äôt narrow it down but Europe seems like the kind of place to do it


Toadscool and toadscruel: mushrooms can be found everywhere, earlier I put foongus and amoonguss in the temperate climate but these two feel more tropical, I‚Äôd say australia is a fitting place for them. Just a hunch of mine though


And with that, not only have a covered a new type, but I have caught up on the types I covered previously. Let me know what type you want me to cover in the future I plan on making this a monthly series",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,PSA: You can restore your save data if Pokemon Scarlet or Violet crashes -- even if autosave was off,"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet keeps a secret backup save, even if autosave is turned off, here's how to access it

1. Shut down the game completely, (close software), then reopen

2. When you reach the Title Screen,  press UP + X + B at the same time

If you did this correctly, you will now see a screen that shows the details of your backup save with the option ‚ÄúLoad Backup Save File‚Äù shown in the bottom right.

pokemon,So slow? Why?,"Why are there so many times throughout the game where the gameplay is intentionally slow

-gym battles: so much dialogue. I don‚Äôt mind a bit before the battle but why the hell did they decide to input dialogue during the battles that you can‚Äôt skip. It‚Äôs infuriating (the electric gym made me want to throw my switch at a small child)

-status and damage after turn moves: these take soooo long during battle. I‚Äôm talking about fire spin and status conditions like poison. Battles feel so slow sometimes, even worse when the game is lagging. 

-switching Pok√©mon: for some reason switching Pok√©mon feels very clunky and, you guessed it, slow. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just because the game isn‚Äôt running fast but JESUS. 

-no battle animation option: this is huge for me. Once I‚Äôve seen enough of the game I want the animations off. They don‚Äôt even let you have the option? Pathetic

-this may be false, but I remember you could use any of the directional pads to choose options. And also the ZR and ZL bumpers could accept an option. This doesn‚Äôt work in this game and I am trying to understand why. Maybe the open world mechanics? 

I‚Äôm sure there are other things I‚Äôm forgetting but seriously this feels slower than DPP. What are your thoughts? 

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am having fun, but I‚Äôm slowly getting more and more agitated going through the game.

First, I would like to make it clear I'm not here to convince you that the game is bad, quite the opposite, I can completely understand why it's a great game for many.

I haven't played since pokemom ORAS, but every since fire red, my favorite part is always building a team, choosing a unbeatable team with a good variety of types.

In pokemon X for example, I played competitively, it was very fun, a different strategy regarding building a team (with nature, IVs, EVs), but it's very cool.

Besides that, I always liked shines, I hatched all three first Gen starters shiny in pokemom X and it was also fun to catch the legendaries.

But that's about it, I never tried to catch them all, I never cared to catch them all. Everyone made it clear that this game was about pokedex and I thought maybe this time could be different but I still don't care about the bedoof, I just want to run away from them.

I just fought and captured the first alpha pokemom (Kricketune) and I'm really afraid that I'm gonna hate the game, so far it's been mediocre for me.

The new QoL changes are great but I had spoiled myself with all that, so that's on me.

If Cubone existed irl, or if an animal always wore its mother‚Äôs skull, scientists would wait until the thing died (or at the very least, sedated it until it was asleep) and then removed the damn skull just to see it. That would completely disrespect the animal! It never wants to separate from it‚Äôs mother, and having the skull removed, exposing its identity, in my opinion, disregards the animals dignity.

Pok√©mon researchers put ethics over knowledge (at least in Cubone‚Äôs case) and never peek inside to see what it looks like, because they respect it enough.

pokemon,Can We Bring Back Mega Evolutions Instead of Moving on to the Next Gimmick?,"When Pokemon X and Y released in 2013, one of the most popular mechanics of the game were Mega Evolutions. A year later, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire released with more mega evolutions as well as a promising new mechanic, Primal Evolutions.

Then it just stops.

After that point, each Pokemon game since then has either tried to replace Mega Evolutions with an alternate gimmick or not have any gimmicks at all. Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon had Mega Evolutions still, but it didn't advance it any further and instead featured Z-crystals. Let's Go had no gimmicks, Sword/Shield has Gigantimax/Dynamax, Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl doesn't have gimmicks, and Legends: Arceus has move styles. And none of them even have Mega Evolutions as an option.

I can understand if Mega Evolutions wasn't popular and so they had to move on and try different things, but Mega Evolutions are very popular from what I've seen and they keep creating new gimmicks while leaving the old gimmicks undeveloped and sidelined! I know they have story reasons for why some games do and don't have mega evolutions, but they're making the games and writing the story so I don't think anyone would argue if they kept Mega Evolutions in forever and expanded upon it.

The more gimmicks they create and sideline, the more of a mess it is going to be with each one as fans of the games have to learn completely new rules when playing older Pokemon games. With X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire it almost seemed like they PLANNED on continuously expanding upon Mega Evolutions. It makes no sense why they stopped.

But after the cutscene where he ate it, he immediately threw up and vomited it out to the floor. We can smoke, smoke bong, drink etc. But where is eating?
If you have visited 24/7 stores, you know you can steal or buy some chocolate bars and candies. But I don't see it as eating.
You can eat very much in IV, eat 4/5 (I couldn't remember) meals in 3 different restaurants counting as either 15 or 12 different meals, and visit more places when on a date on San Andreas.
In Vice City, you can eat one meal in each store.

thesims,Disable oveclocked image uppon computers.,"Hi ! I don't know if you know, but in the Sims 4, with maxed programming skills, you can overclock InGame computers. This provides buffs when using them for programming. But one thing I find annoying, is that overclocked computers always have a little circuit image upon them. I don't like that, because it breaks the ""realism"" of the game, especielly when doing screenshots.

You can see it here : [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/605532970081845347/879756751715586068/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/605532970081845347/879756751715586068/unknown.png)

Do you know is there is a way to hide that image ? With a mod or a special option ? I tried several things to disable the overclocking of the computer I overclocked : tried to breaking it, reset it via debug mode...It don't work. I don't want to replace it because this computer is fully upgraded.

So, any solutions ?",assassinscreed,pos
pokemon,How do you guys think they'll handle HMs in BDSP? (And by extension LA),"It's no secret that the use of HMs made team-building pretty damn restrictive. You needed to spread out the HMs between your team with something to handle the swimming, another mon for flying, rock smashing and strength. That, or you needed to have a HM Mule like our lord and saviour Bibarel. Praise to the Bibarel.

My question is, do you think they'll continue to use HMs for the remakes, or do you think there will be a system similar to SM where you get sort of ""external"" pokemon to handle all of the regular HM uses?

Personally, I feel like they'll pull a SM where you get access to the HM moves in the form of external pokemon after you beat each gym. Like maybe after you beat Roark, instead of getting Rock Smash, you get to use a Cranidos for smashing rocks. After defeating Maylene, you can use a Staraptor to fly around the region. Things like that.

So yeah, how do you think they'll handle it? Will they change it or keep it the same?",FIFA,neg

pokemon,How did Sword and Shield selling THAT much...?,"Let's not fool ourself: Pokemon Sword/Shield is really disappointing. Between the cut of the National Pokedex, a really lackluster story, a technical aspect with not much care and a post game that you... basically have to buy aside of th main game (the two expansions are basically the standard post-game of a Pokemon game... sold separately...), Sword/Shield is an incredibly disappointing game, as a Pokemon game AND as a standalone game. And yet somehow it managed to sell SOOOOO much. It sold over 20 millions of copies, which is a record compared to most of the previous installments of the series. The only games that sold more are the original Red/Blue/Yellow and the original Gold/Silver/Crystal, making Sw/Sh the third best selling game in the entire franchise. 

And to that I have a simple question with a single word: HOW?! How the hell did such a mediocre pokemon game selling like bread? Games like Emerald or Platinum, Heart Gold/Soul Silver or Black/White 1 and 2 were FAR more worthy than this lazy mess, and yet they all sold far less than it. How is that even possible?

The stepmom being a Templar is supposed to be a twist I guess but it's clear from the diary pages by like chapter 4 that she is one. Jeanne knows this and when Aveline finally finds her they have a very brief introduction and then it cuts to the next sequence. Why didn't Jeanne tell Aveline about her stepmother?

And the Agate stuff doesn't make sense either, he thinks Aveline is going to kill him so he just kills himself? Didn't Jeanne also fear Agate because she didn't wanna go scorched earth yet she doesn't talk about that with her own daughter? 

It's very clear the stepmom is poisoning the dad yet Aveline is either too dumb to notice or just decides to only care about it at the end.

But in Black and White, whenever you played an online match-made game, you could switch the game off before a loss and suffer zero consequences: the winner does not get a win and you do not get a loss on your record.

pokemon,Do you think Red/Blue should have different teams in the Gold/Silver games?,"I think that it was unfair that Red had all three starters whereas Blue had none. Also, it felt wrong for Red to be the one from the Yellow version; since Gold/Silver were two games, they should be connected to Red/Blue, which also were two games. Pikachu should be totally left out too, since it gives off a Yellow/anime vibe, which is different from the ambience of the original Red/Blue games. 

That said, I think Blue's team should be the same as in the first two games had he started out with Squirtle. As for Red, his team should consist of:

\-Charizard

\-Lapras (a lot was said in Gold/Silver about Red's feat of disbanding Team Rocket and that was where you get Lapras in the first games, so it would be a nice allusion).

\-Two Snorlaxes (which implies that Red caught both of them in the first game, which is pretty cool; also, since they can learn a variety of moves, each of them could have a different arsenal).

\-Espeon

\-As for his trump card, I'm undecided. It could be Mew, since, during the Red/Blue games' era, nobody knew how to catch him and a big deal was made out of that pokemon, so it would be badass if it turned out that the 'true' Red caught him after all.

thesims,Sims 4 Worlds IRL,"I've been doing some thinking and researching for a project I set myself and I've been trying to pinpoint where the different worlds would be if they were on a real world map. Some of these aren't perfect because a few worlds are a mix of different places but this is what I have so far:

Willow Creek/Magnolia Promenade - New Orleans. This I think? has been confirmed and it's just the right place yk. I put Magnolia Promenade here because it has Willow Creek Hospital and Police Station so logically it's near Willow Creek.

Oasis Springs - I put this in Texas because of the whole desert situation and the Spanish vibes architecture also just seemed to fit (I'm a Brit so not quite as knowledgeable on specific areas of the US).

Newcrest - I went Michigan for Newcrest because of the style of skyscrapers and also the flora seemed to kind of fit with the area.

Windenburg - I had a debate with myself over this but settled for Bavaria in Germany because of the style of building and also the world name. It was harder because their was obviously influences from all over Europe in the world but I went with the closest.

Granite Falls - I put Yosemite because it just looks ridiculously similar lmao.

San Myshuno - I had so many issues trying to figure out where to place this but I decided on Singapore because it seemed the most accurate but still not 100% set on it.

Forgotten Hollow - Clich√© but Transylvania. I know it doesn't really look like it but it was too perfect of an oppurtunity.

Brindleton Bay - New England. It had English-esque architecture but was way too Americanised so this was the closest.

Selvadorada - Central America, specifically Guatemala and El Salvador sort of area as it had the Aztec style ruins but also the rainforest.

Del Sol Valley - LA. No explanation needed.

StrangerVille - I marked down StrangerVille in Nevada right next to Area 51.

Sulani - French Polynesia seemed to fit really well for Sulani. The small individual islands and buildings were very similar.

Evergreen Harbour - I based this more off what I saw other people saying and decided on Spokane in Washington.

Mt Komorebi - I wasn't sure exactly whereabouts but obviously put this in Japan.

Henford on Bagley - The Cotswolds. I mean it just embodies it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm really stuck on Britechester and Glimmerbrook. Britechester I was thinking maybe Oxford because of the canals but it just seems too American to fit there, the architecture especially in Foxbury is also way too modern to really fit. Glimmerbrook I just have no clue.

&amp;#x200B;

Feedback and help would be appreciated!

What I don't like are games where you can't one-hit kill opponents. If I was to play AC Valhalla, I'd play the game like Agent 47 and go in with a ""one shot, one kill"" strategy. I don't want to be involved in major boss battles where the enemy won't die in one hit. I'm going to play at an extremely slow pace and make sure I rely entirely on stealth to eliminate enemies one by one. Is AC Valhalla the right game for me?

CallOfDuty,[COD] Whats up w it,Call me old but i dont like the theatrics in call of duty nowadays. Before it used to be exaggerated but realistic still. I watch the new warzone season 3 intro and im left baffled. Firstly why are russian soldiers carrying ppsh a ww2 gun whilst defending a top secret base. Im also certain their policy is shoot on site at a top secret base. I think itd be better creating scenes that aren't made up in fairytale land. The lady at the start rather brutally guns a man down showing no signs of resistance as if thats 'cool' its just stupid and not the mindset encouraged in the military. Its about getting a job done. If they have to kill they do it precise and efficient not for theatrics. And i imagine its more badass than what call of duty created. To be a company promoting military rememberace whilst glorifying brutal murder isn't in line with the morals of the military. It also doesn't help the situation with countries like russia feeling they are portrayed as evil and some pathetic swine that can be gunned down so easily. If it was roles reversed you would have the same reactions on our side. I wouldn't appreciate this representation of military of my own country so i understand their perception. I guess this is how the world is turning with military games but there is a community still that would enjoy more realistic games. Instead i feel like theyre being made to satisfy the fortnite kids. But i thought the game was supposed to be rated 18?,FIFA,pos

pokemon,"Teddiursa &amp; Ursaring - Toad's Daily Pok√©mon Ranking, 216 &amp; 217","[Introducing the first Normal type line to gain an evolution with a new typing in a later generation!](https://preview.redd.it/e8x09g7jvzqa1.png?width=1437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6a06968e95009f80b763b1591d1a9cc6f7ae8378)

**216: Teddiursa**

Teddiursa is an absolutely adorable teddy bear Pok√©mon and I like it a lot! I think in the whacky over the top Pokedex we've covered in Johto, Teddiursa stands out for striking a very unique balance. It's both a cute, simple design but it has it's own vibes and identity going for it beyond that - with it's connection both to bear cubs and the moon, presented on it's forehead. 

Teddiursa surprisingly got a lot of focus in recent generations that elevated it's presence to me - it's line was featured as one of the 10 core Pok√©mon in Legends Arceus, and then it got to be the ace Pokemon of Gym Leader Katy in Paldea, using a Bug Type Tera Form representing it's honey in her baking. I think the biggest thing that made me realize how pleasant Teddiursa's vibes were that the as the Pok√©mon showed up more, I didn't mind it at all and smiled as though it was a core regular in the franchise.

I think at the end of the day, Teddiursa is simple but it starts off a good line in a strong way, and I like it. I'm a sucker for stuffed animals in real life and it's just a cute Pok√©mon with some neat behaviors. It's too simple to be one of my favorites, but I think a low **B Tier** score is quite fitting.

[Fanart found on Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/qr9xxfddwzqa1.jpg?width=256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6481974100415ae3004db2e6fda0990f511529bd)

&amp;#x200B;

**217: Ursaring**

This one is kind of disappointing though. Despite being the final stage for Teddiursa for a very long time, Ursaring really felt way too boring and simple by comparison. Like Noctowl, it seems to abandon most of Teddiursa's motifs like honey, stuffed animals, and night time, but unlike Noctowl, it isn't charismatic enough of a design to pick up the slack. 

Ursaring is just... a bear. A bear with a yellow circle on it's belly which took me way too long was still supposed to be a full moon. But it still feels like a last ditch attempt, like Teddiursa was just another Johtonian one-stage line that they realize could not stand alone, and came running in with a random bear and painted a yellow circle on it's belly to claim it still preserved the motif.

I don't hate it, it's cool enough, they do some cool things with it. I like how it looks in the modern games, and watching Teddiursas gather around an Alpha Ursaring was really really neat. But it still is... disappointing, and feels incredibly average for a promising line. **C Tier.**

But man. Man oh man do I LOVE it's evolution. Ursaluna for the absolute win! We'll get to that in a few years.

pokemon,One thing that I‚Äôm glad Scarlet and Violet brought back to the franchise,"For Gens 1-5, Pok√©mon games were constantly building off of each other. You can tell with every entry that they wanted to out-do themselves and make each game bigger and better than the last. Gen 5 felt like they really put their all into the game. 

But once Gen 6 came around, it seemed like the games kind of stayed stagnant. They didn‚Äôt really care about making a better game than the older ones, just making a game that reminds you of the older ones. All the focus that used to be on improving the series went towards marketing gimmicks instead of improvement. 

It worked, Pokemon became more successful than ever during the Gen 6-8 era. So I can‚Äôt say they made the wrong choice. 

But Gen 9 finally feels like Gamefreak wants to make something special again. They fell short in many aspects, but I can see the soul in the series again. It feels like they actually want to improve the series instead of just keeping everything the same and changing one or two things. 

I‚Äôm excited for the future. I hope the next game can be the one where it all comes together perfectly.",pokemon,neg

pokemon,why are the other Paradox's not Legendaries and Koraidon and Miraidon are?,"
Spoilers ahead for end-game, so if you haven't completed The Way Home (4th storyline after completing Victory Road, Path of Legends, and Operation Starfall), leave now.

If Koraidon and Miraidon are just Past and Future Paradox forms of Cyclizar, then what makes them so special compared to the Paradox forms, like Past Salamence or Future Tyranitar? If anything, they should be weaker, Cyclizar is a 1 stage evo pokemon with mediocre stats and isn't very viable in a playthrough. Salamence, Tyranitar, Gardevoir/Gallade, all are beasts in their own right, and are just as much in their Paradox forms. But for some reason, gamefreak appears to have just made Paradox Cyclizar a Gary/Mary Sue for some reason?

I just think the roles of and choice for the legendary pokemon in these games are just poor and lazy and don't make sense when faced with the reasoning and logic behind their legendary titles, when there are other paradoxes of stronger pokemon that pale in comparison (stats-wise and title-wise) for some reason.
This is not a diss on Koraidon and Miraidon, I love them both in design, but the reasoning for them being legendaries but not the other Paradox's makes no sense to me. Obviously, if they were all legendaries, that'd just be too many, so I don't think they should've made Koraidon and Miraidon legendaries.

I'm definitely thinking too much on this, but honestly, I don't think the people who made them thought enough.",pokemon,pos

assassinscreed,Queen Victoria in Syndicate,"A mate and I were talking the other day about where/when we'd most like to see an AC game set (I'm for the roaring 20s btw). He mentioned India in the 1600s just before the British invaded. In this instance, the story would either have to stretch on to the days of Gandhi, or the main storyline would probably end with the Assassin's losing. And this reminded me of a huge problem I had wth Syndicate: Queen Victoria.

While the character was well played, well voiced and quite endearing, I was pretty shocked to find \[SPOILER ALERT\] that she isn't a Templar. Surely as the head of the British state - and thus the British Empire, which was all about control through force - she'd be a Templar or at least in cahoots with them?  


When you look at the British Empire's M.O. - arrive in a foreign land, take over the running of said land from the locals, help yourself to their natural resources while imposing your culture, language and belief system on them - it smacks of the Templar credo, that is:  [their conviction that true peace can only be achieved when humanity is shepherded by a society of enlightened individuals‚Äîin their eyes, them.](https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Templars)

pokemon,I am pretty sure Walking Wake is a convergent species rather than a direct ancestor or relative of Suicune,"The reasoning behind this statement:
- Suicune is a kitten, not a birdo
- Unlike all paradox forms, regional forms, and even the other convergent mons, there isn't any proportionality or direct retention of stats
- Same for the movepool, other than the commonly learnt water type moves, Walking Wake does not learn any of the Flying, Psychic, and Ice type moves that are commonly associated with Suicune.
- The burnt tower fiasco, even though it may be just a legend to mourn a once beloved monument, so this last one is a weak one

What I think is that Walking Wake has developed similar attributes to those of Suicune because those attributes help it to fill a similar ecological niche in a Suicune-less ancient Pok√©mon world.",thesims,pos

pokemon,"In games that permit it, do you enjoy playing parts out of order?","Recently I have been replaying some of the older games, namely remakes of them, in order to try and complete some old regional dexes and also make a Living Dex of mons from their debut generations. To spice things up, in FireRed and SoulSilver, I have been playing stuff out of the normal order I play. 

In FireRed I saved Sabrina for after I beat Blaine, and did Blaine as soon as I beat Koga and could Surf. I didn't even touch Silph Co. till after. In SoulSilver I did the Mahogany Town stuff before beating Chuck and Jasmine, while I normally touch them after Jasmine. I have found switching things up to be pretty enjoyable!

So it got me thinking: what order do you like doing these things that can be done out of order? Have you changed the order you play these segments in games (including ones I haven't mentioned!) between playthroughs, and how did you like doing that?",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,Opinions on Pok√©mon go clothes and prices?,"I personally don't mind the style too much, although I would prefer more chunky or thick clothes, like the willow set. They're thin, they're short (short sleeves, cropped trousers, etc), and almost all the good ones are overpriced. One of my favourite sets is the team aqua set, and I spent weeks in gyms to afford it all (at about 200 coins for just the shirt, you can imagine how long that took), then when I changed from a fem avatar to a masc one, I can't access the masc set. I would've thought buying a set meant buying for both avatars, given the prices of the clothes. It's put me off buying clothes at all to be honest, since I don't want to spend 150 coins on a hat or a shirt that I can only use for one avatar. On top of that, the men's trousers are lackluster and leave something to be desired, and the default shorts are just ugly in my opinion, the various level/quest unlocks are better though.

I think I'm biased as an NB person who switches avatars, but if you ask me, the clothes are overpriced and the price should include both sets, or the sets that you buy should be available for both avatars (IE, wearing the fem aqua set on a male avatar). I think niantic is making them overpriced and the default clothes lackluster to make people spend and play more, but I also don't think that's an excuse. What are your opinions?",legostarwars,pos

GTA,What are the actual problems with the definitive editions?,"Obviously these editions got hated and memed on mercilessly at launch. Anyways, I played and completed them all recently and I had a good time. There were quality of life improvements that were very much needed like camera control and button configuration.

I came across no bugs, no framerate issues, and I didn't fall through the floor. 

The graphics were better than the last ports to modern consoles.

If there were weird aestetic changes, I must have blinked, because there was nothing egregious.

Is the problem not about what the games are, but what they're not. Is it simply that the remasters weren't to the same quality as Mafia's? 

I'm aware that some songs were missing, but is that down to Rockstar or the record labels?

I guess if you're playing on PC, there's might be a bunch of mods that improve on the originals more than the definitive editions, but as a console player, I can't comprehend the extreme levels of vitriol.

Anyways, I had a fun time playing nostalgic games and just wondering what I'm missing.",pokemon,neg

GTA,Long term speculation,"Prediction A) If GTA VI comes out 2024/25, my prediction is earliest 2031/32 for GTA VII. That would be about 2-3 years into the next console generation, that allows Rockstar to milk GTA VI enhanced when the new consoles are released near the end of this decade. My speculation is GTA 7 is set in Las Vegas. Las Vegas would be an opportunity to play on the numbers 777 and explore a new setting.

&amp;#x200B;

Prediction B) If not Las Vegas, my second guess is back to a new version of Liberty City to celebrate 30 years after GTA III. Rockstar probably releases GTA 4 Enhanced version on the new consoles coming at the end of this decade to build up hype for GTA VII in 2031.

Someone said how they'd be too primitive, (which they definitely were not!) and watching sacrifices would be too disturbing.. (which one could just not do those missions/skip them)

assassinscreed,Getting bored of the series. suggestion?,"Hi all, since covid started and I was able to finish my work at home early everyday with some time to spare, I made a mission to catch up on old Assassins Creed games that I never got to play before.

I started from AC2 as it seemed a popular opinion to skip AC1 due to boring/repetitive game mechanics. I was blown away by AC2 and couldn't believe it was over 10 year old game graphically and gameplay wise. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried to complete all the side quests and finding all the treasure boxes, but kinda gave up being a completionist after realizing that I don't enjoy going all over the maps finding every feathers.

I finished the Brotherhood and liked it (though not as much as AC2) and got right onto Revelations. I actually got bored about 2/3 into Revelations but just followed the main quest line and forced myself to finish it (couldn't wait to just be done with it). I was going to take a little break, but ended up starting the Black Flag (I wanted to do AC3 remastered but only BF was on Steam sale at that time).

I initially didn't like AC4 Black Flag but half way through it, I found myself enjoying the game once again.

When AC3 and AC5 Unity were on sale, I ended up picking up both. I was averaging about 2 weeks per game and perhaps back to back was a bit much.

I started AC3 about 2 weeks ago with 3 more sequence to go but I am bored out of my mind at this point. I am just wondering if I am feeling burned out or what.

The thought of playing Unity after this is just dreadful. But I was told there's quite a bit of game mechanics/combat system change from Unity so I am thinking maybe it's worth it to continue.

Does it get better after AC3/AC4? Should I take a break from the series and go play something else for awhile?",pokemon,pos

assassinscreed,Would you be opposed to permanent companion characters?,"Most AC protagonists are lone wolves because this is the nature of open-world games. This has the downside of making each game feel weirdly isolating as you only interact with characters in cutscenes and then go off to do your own thing.

But what If we had 2 or 3 named characters who are always at your side for the whole game? Something like the party systems in old Bioware games. Fully fleshed out characters with backstories who are involved in the entire main story.

I had the idea because Eivor has a whole crew of nameless Viking dudes who just sit in the boat. It makes it impossible to have a story like the Last Kingdom where Uhtred has a small following of loyal crew who are very involved in the story.

Gameplay-wise it could be something like the brotherhood feature from uh.. Brotherhood. But more balanced around multiple characters. AC3 let you have named followers but like a lot of things in AC3 it could have been executed better.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Idea: What if these two setting existed in the Pokemon World?,"I'm generally a guy into locations and settings, so I'll be proposing a speculative concept that's been on my mind for some time.

I won't give them names. I'll leave it up to you.

Two cities. One purposely built at bottom of the ocean and one floating high up in the sky. Based on the cities of Rapture and Columbia from the Bioshock series. What ould they be like and how could they fit into the pokemon universe?

I won't be that expository on the details but here's some i have in mind:

Both cities would share similarities to their Bioshock counterparts in terms of Architecture, their age (being built in the pokemon equivalent of the 1880's or 1940's), and being among some the most technologically advanced cities in the world. They'd ought to be since there would be the drive to push the boundaries of and overcoming limitations of the technology during the time of construction. Having the to invent and develop new technologies for either two to be built in such Impossible places. Many a breakthroughs were made just to keep one floating in the sky and the to keep the sea out of other. The Underwater city having a supercomputer similar to Rapture's Thinker to regulate the automated systems of the city. Keeping them running for the long term and keeping the city habitable for it's population and businesses to live in and operate. Like Rapture, the city would use similar naming conventions for locations and major business. Being named after deities and mythological figures. legendary pokemon in this case.

Both cities are completely autonomous and not fixed to any specific region in the Pokemon World. One is located in what would esientially be International Waters while the other is constantly on the move.

Another similarity to the two cities is the Way they're accessed: Lighthouses. The Lighthouse for the underwater city would be used to mark it's location, similar to that as Rapture's Lighthouse. However, the island it's on is much bigger and has been expanded so that passenger ships and seaplanes could dock. Access into the city would be done through automated submersibles as with Rapture or alternatively via an elevator ride or an undersea monorail. The ""lighthouse"" or ""lighthouses"" for the floating City would be a series of mooring masts built across the Pokemon world at destinations where the flying City would fly over. Each having beacons to mark their locations and to guide the Floating city to their positions. Special zeppelins would then dock, take on passengers and tourists, and then fly to the city.

That's where the similarities end. The differences now are that Flying and Water Types are the themes for these cities and why they were built where they are instead of being founded upon and around a philosophy or ideology. Entirely new Legendaries could also be responsible for the founding and conception of these cities as well. Likely influencing"" specific Human individuals, showing them a visions and prompting them to actually build these cities in an attempt to reach out and live alongside these legendaries.

Not going to put Genetic and Trans-dimensional advances into the equation since those would just wreak havoc on the rest of the world if it's suddenly possible to open up gateways into alternate universes or Humans gaining the powers of pokemon through specially made genetic serums.

As justification as to why they'd even exist, these cities would be one of many instances/constants of Rapture and Columbia that manifest and exist in different universes as established in Bioshock: Infinite. Constants and Variables. There's always a City, there's always a Lighthouse,and  there's always a Man.",legostarwars,pos

FinalFantasy,FF7 *SPOILERS* Blind Run 9: Where is My Materia - The Pixies,"**SPOILERS**

**Please don't spoil the game for me either! This is an update on my blind playthrough of Final Fantasy VII. I'm playing on Nintendo Switch, but I am not using the optional features like the Zero Encounter, √ó3, or the Limit MAX. I'm also using the D-Pad so it feels more similar to the PS1 which didn't have a Joy Stick.**    
    
I think I understand why Yuffie is the way that she is now. It's not like I like that she is this way, but I understand.    
    
She grew up in a manipulative tourist trap full of secrets passageways. Around traditions that no one believes in anymore, and a building which literally doesn't let outsiders in. Her culture is literally just taking from people who don't know better, and using it to help the town.    
    
I searched all over for her in all kinds of spots through town. And then when I found her, she took me back to her home, and explained that her town is barely able to get by on tourists. That they need materia to help their town. (This is supported by the shop which advertises Materia, but doesn't actually have any). After all of this betrayal, and after losing his town, and then his next town, Cloud says    
 ""I don't care about your feelings. I don't care about this town. Just give us back the materia, and we'll drop it"".    
    
This adventure is just stacking up the losses. Cid's dreams, the Slums, Biggs, Wedge, Jessie, Dyne.    
    
I think Cloud is getting tired of being in these difficult situations. Tired of chasing, and being chased. All while Sephiroth and Shinra are out there. Yuffie is a distraction we really wouldn't be able to afford if it weren't for her stealing the Materia. She's so stupid thay she can't see how much bigger all of this is.    
    
But she doesn't deserve to have all of the frustration and trauma taken out on her... she's doing what she thinks she needs to do.    
    
Elena, Rude, and Reno are on holiday in Wutai when they are pressured by Shinra to search for us. Elena really wants to do her best, but Reno is insistent that they are on vacation and shouldn't fight us.    
Elena believes that she should work, and sacrifice in order to do what's right, and insists on searching for Cloud. Reno responds by saying ""Those who sacrifice themselves for a cause aren't brave. They're fools.""    
Elena gets mad and runs off.    
    
I search for Yuffie all over, but then I find out that she, and Elena have been taken by an enemy from way back at the beginning... Don Corneo.    
    
After a fight with some Shinra soldiers, Corneo takes Yuffie, and Elena to the top of Da-Chao mountain, where he hangs them by their wrists high above their ground on a statue.    
    
Reno, and Rude agree to put differences with my group aside in order to save out teammates.    
    
We work our way up the mountain (I collected something called the Dragon Lance. I wonder if it's a reference to the Dracon Lance books like how Biggs and Wdge are Star Wars Characters) I find Corneo, and fight Rapps, the sequel to his pet Aps from before. (In retrospect, I wonder if Aps is a mutant version of Heavy Tank? Or maybe Heavy Tank is a Cyborg version of Aps?)    
    
Corneo reveals that he has a remote to drop the gals if I attack him, but rights as I think Corneo has outsmarted us all, RENO AND RUDE SAVE THE DAY!    
    
Reno kills Corneo, an leaves us be. I think... I think this was an important storyline to see right now. Even after so many friends become enemies, some of our enemies become our friends. It's really nice to see, and I think I'm ready for the Ancient Temple.

pokemon,What are the must-have features in a Pok√©dex app/website?,"Hi all, I'm working on a Pok√©dex and I was wondering what kind of information you really need and use in a Pok√©dex. 

For me, the basics are the evolution chain and a type table (and of course the types themselves :)). But one of the most important things for me is that it should be easy to find the shiny version of the sprites. I always forget what the shiny version of a Pok√©mon looks like, so being able to see it right away is key for me. 

Also, because I play all the games at the same time, I really need multi-game support (so that a Pok√©mon can be marked as caught separately for each game). 

I have used a lot of different apps over the years, but have never been fully satisfied. So I'm currently building my own Pok√©dex app for Android called Dex Tracker. I've been working on it for over a year and it's the first app that I've programmed. 

I'm trying to add moves to the app, because I think that's important too, but I'm still thinking about how to add them efficiently. 

Please check out the app and give me feedback on what features you are missing and what features you always use in a Pok√©dex.

We‚Äôd get to see and meet more historical figures such as Gandhi. We‚Äôd get to see the in depth look at how Indians were treated by the British and the events that took place during their fight for independence, as well as the Bengal Famine and its effects, and the war against the Japanese. 

I don‚Äôt want to hear anything about it being ‚Äútoo modern‚Äù as assassins creed needs to become more modernized anyway. There is SO MUCH history to tell all over the world from the beginning of recorded history to now, it doesn‚Äôt all have to be fought with swords and arrows. Plus with Assassins creed already moving into a different play style since Origins, it‚Äôs okay to branch out even more. We got games like AC3 and AC4 that has guns and a lot of people loved and enjoyed it. Open up a little and let AC take a new direction while staying true to the Assassins Creed and Templar Order from the OG games. Ww2 wasn‚Äôt just fought on the battlefield.

For the new style: The Cult of Kosmos system

FIFA,The game is unironically bad,"I know there's the joke that people who play fifa always say how bad it is, but they still play weekly. But no the game is actually just awful right now in my opinion.

I decided to play fut champs this weekend, after I had stopped playing around like mid December, only playing the odd draft. So obviously my team is a bit outdated, however it should still be at least... Functional? Previously I would've been finishing with about 52 or so points this year or gold 2 or 1 in previous years.

I have Messi, Ronaldo and IF Foden up front, but between them and my midfield of Keita Verratti and Pogba, I literally cannot string passes together. I don't know what it is but any through ball, short pass, long pass I make, it is literally like there is a magnet on the opposition defenders. It use to be if I lost I would still have maybe won on xG or had very good xG, but that's not even the case now, I really struggle to even get a shot away because my players cannot play simple passes without it going astray, or if I dribble it's as though Messi and Ronaldo have clown shoes on or something. 

Shooting wise when I finally do get a shot, idk if EA released some patch at some point where there's specific shots that work now, but I really struggle to score. Like at the start of the year I really liked the buffed keepers, your shots would still at least have a chance of scoring, right now it feels no matter what I do it goes wide or hits the post. And when it is on target for some reason there's a lot of people using 79 rated Lafont. I don't know what he's on, maybe the stuff FIFA 18 Butland was on, but he just stops everything. 

On defence my players nearly feel invisible. Rttf Traore still performs, but varane, marq and fit birthday Hernandez have been nothing short of woeful in defence, I'm not sure if it's because everyone I've come up against is just holding L1 whilst dribbling, but I literally cannot make a successful tackle or else the entire defence just gets completely bypassed by 1 pass. Not to mention it feels like Marq and Varane have took a hit to the head and have lost like 40 iq. In goals Alisson has been completely atrocious, getting lobbed while on the line, conceding from 40 yards out, getting ball rolled left right and centre. It seems it doesn't matter what I do on defence, my players just get bypassed, however the opposite while I am attacking were titans like gold kimpembe completely destroy me. 

Basically the point of this post is, did something happen the game the last few months in terms of updates? And was wondering if anyone else experiences these issues with the game (which I'd say pretty much everyone experiences)",FIFA,pos

Sometimes my players will just constantly being making perfect runs, every pass connects etc. 

Now this could be explained if I was just playing better/worse players or tactics which counter mine but I‚Äôm not. 
I‚Äôll be playing someone with a god squad, green timing everything, mbappe and Jairzinho flip flapping, borderline pro player yet I go 2-0 up with my attackers + defence performing like I mentioned and I go onto win.

FIFA,Brazil 1970 tactics 18-2 fut champs,"#Background
Ref https://www.fmscout.com/a-brazil-1970-tactic-recreation-fm20.html

Brazil had an influx of number 10s within their squad/shape and you could say this influenced Zagallo to play all of Brazil‚Äôs best under one tactic. The front two (Tost√£o &amp; Pel√©) didn't play as typical 'strikers'. Both players had drop deeper into midfielder areas collecting the ball but this meant Brazil now had no main influence or target inside the box. Given the quality of attacking players, this was not needed. Tost√£o was very smart with his movements, he would drop into deeper areas, this allowed Pel√©, no denying was the star of the show, had made similar movements and this created wonderful interchanges where all attackers could benefit from the space created by the two. He was the prime playmaker, whilst Tost√£o resembled more of a false 9. 

Rivelino (LW) played more as a typical winger, though a natural Attacking Midfielder, He would/could play more narrow, not only creating a slight overload with Pele and Gerson, but also created a three-man midfield with the two central midfielders as Revelino would also drop deeper. 

Jairzinho (RW) had pace like no other! Using his pace to exploit open spaces created by, mainly Tost√£o, and get into very good goalscoring positions. He would often make the run from wider into inside positions but his off-the-ball movement was just as great as his skills on the ball. On the ball, he terrorised opposition defences when running at them

In goal was F√©lix, Carlos Alberto was a very offensive wing back, constantly up and down the flank. With Jairzinho looking to make the run inside meant Carlos Alberto mostly had the flank to himself, not to forget, he was the captain of the side. Everaldo was a lot more cautious than Carlos Alberto and this brought excellent balance with the back 4. Piazza was a defender who was VERY comfortable on the ball and understandable, as naturally he was a Midfielder. Brito was more a standard CB at the time, you could say he had least skill in the team but that would be unfair to say Clodoaldo and G√©rson operated as the midfield pivot, Gerson was another creative player in this Brazil set-up but he could create play from deeper positions, not only keeping the team ticking in deeper areas but had the vision to pick out some outrageous passes. Clodoaldo was more the tough guy in midfield, looking to win the ball back for his team. Calling him a Ball-Winning-Midfielder may take away some of the quality he also possessed on the ball. With the left flank dominated by Rivelino and Tostao edging wide, the right-hand side of the pitch had a lot of space to be exploited. Naturally Jairzinho pushed inside despite his right-footedness, which left a lot of room for the onrushing captain, Carlos Alberto. Tostao and Pele were two number 10s upfront, but the later was the main playmaker and star of the show, while the other had a more pressing type role.

Brazil's build up from the back had to happen with some speed, not direct but with speed to get the ball to the more advanced and creative players. A lot of vertical passes from deeper areas but Brazil was very versatile with their play which made it almost impossible to defend or guess what was going to happen next. Players played with extreme flair and freedom, 'Capoeira' focused on free bodily movement, an Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music and this is how the players moved around the pitch, with freedom and elegance.

pokemon,"Pokemon Violet/Scarlet 5 star raids need nerfs, seriously.","So, after playing violet and raiding for a week I've come to the conclusion that 5 star raids specifically lack any real balance and results impossible circumstances at worst, or at the very least is bad content. 4 star and below are easy enough to clear solo with a good Pok√©mon, and 6 star raids, being the end-game of end-game raids are appropriately difficult for what they are, although I've only done like 5-6 of them successfully. But this post is about the 5 star specifically.

Why do I think this? Here are my top 5 reasons.

1. 5 star raids are unlocked pre-post game BEFORE the Pok√©mon league, giving the player the idea that they are simply a modest step up from lvl 4s like 2-3 and 3-4 were. The game does NOT tell you that it is in fact an increase to lvl 75 pokemon, which outlevels all other in-game content including the league, the post-league champ fight and area zero content, and the tournament AFTER the credits. My complaint here is simple, don't give players content its impossible to do at the stage you unlock it. Why is it virtually impossible? See complaint 2.
2. In addition to being level 75, these 5 star Pok√©mon have insane stats, so insane that you not only need a perfect team of max-iv/max-ev lvl 100 Pok√©mon to pull it off consistently, but even that doesn't work half the time in online battles. How insane you ask? well I'm glad you did because I have some recent examples of how insane they really are. Two matches that came to mind were against a [Baxcalibur](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sv/baxcalibur/)(ice terra) and another being Orthworm(water terra):

2a. The first one I used a lvl 99 Tinkaton with perfect Ivs and evs, adamant nature because it resists ice and dragon type moves nicely. 270 attack with a steel move with base 160 power + stab. How much damage does this does this do? like maybe 5% hp to the dude. Now, Gigatonhammer being so powerful can only be used once every 2 turns, and only has 5 pp, so the most you can do with it is 25% of the health of the target by yourself. This is insanely low damage in my mind when compounded with all other things you gotta deal with(outlined later). This makes solo impossible with this pokemon, who should shit on this guy 10 ways to sunday with his type in a normal matchup.

2b. Now this second one is equally silly, but perhaps underlines a different issue. Orthworm being a steel type with water terra meant you could either bring bug, grass, or electric to fight it. Having grinded somewhat now that i've been in postgame for 4-5 days now, i decided to bring Leafeon lvl 100,(just assume i'm always using best iv/evs). Now you might say to yourself, ok well Orthworm has 145 base defense, and i'd say yeah that's like insanely good. But of course I only have so many level 100s to choose from and my guy is 25 levels above them and is terra grass with swords dance so i should be able to buff my way to some good damage. Well, boy was i wrong, even after two swords dances, i was doing like 1% of its hp with leaf blade. Now, according to pokemon damage calculator, at +3 to a normal oathworm(it coiled once) 25 levels below me, i'd be doing between 84-99% of its hp depending on the role. So i was doing like 1/84th of the % health damage I would expect, meaning its defense was so boosted that i was doing &lt; 3% of the damage i would normally do to that pokemon.

3. Taking into account these 2 examples which are just a couple of many I could talk about, this next complaint compounds this issue. I just gave examples of how defensively these terra raid Pok√©mon get insane buffs, but these buffs are offensive as well, meaning that if you get hit by something neutral and not resisted? Yeah you're probably getting 2-3 shot by that. Now I hear some people out there, ""just bring something that resists all its moves"", yeah...don't worry, we'll get to that later. So...given the hyper offense capability of a lot of these fully evolved pokemon(and god forbid they get a stat boosting ability like coil or calm mind), its finally time to talk about the actual mechanic of terra raids that makes this broken as all heck. Terra raids are real time, meaning that all players move at the same time for their attacks more or less and these inputs are buffered by relative speed against your opponent in order to determine the order of attack. Now, i was all for this system initially, not having to wait for everyone to go through their turn to attack? Brilliant! Except...they gave the terra pokemon the ability to do it also. So...from what i can tell, the tera raid pokemon on every interval (because no turns) will select an attack and hit EVERY pokemon at the same time on your team with it, and it calculates this damage value as if it is attacking a singular pokemon. This causes a few problems with a few different types of moves:3a. So, for those who dont know, moves like rockslide and surf and moves that attack multiple pokemon at once generally have some of their overall damage nerfed on each one individual to balance out the fact it hits everything, where Pok√©mon only receive full damage from the move when they are the only one being hit by it. Since terra Pok√©mon however perform their attack on an individual basis rather than a group hit with these moves, that means it is performing the full damage on each pokemon rather than splitting the damage. This means they are basically ignoring the mechanic of damage splitting.

3b.  Status moves, oh god here we go. So lets just start off with the obvious, if your opponent has sleep, para, or burn if you are physically, you are utterly fucked. Not only will they hit all players Pok√©mon with this ability, meaning that they can sleep your whole party in one interval but they can spam it multiple times between your ""turn"" ( see 4). good luck doing enough damage in the time limit with only 2 of your party doing damage/setting up.

3c. Single target attacks are just that, single target. they are balanced around hitting one person per turn. So obvious problem here when terra raid pokemon can hit 4 pokemon at the same time with a single target attack doing full damage to each of them. Coupled with #2s problem, and this means they are dishing out a crap ton of dps per interval.

4. So...you've seen me use the word interval to take the place of where a turn normally would. And here is my #2 reason that this system is dogshit. First things first, you better select the moveo you wanna do fast, because if you dont guess what your ""interval"" is getting skipped to play animations for everyone else and the terra pokemon. So pokemon, which is supposed to be tactical thinking now becomes a rush job to think what your next move will be as fast as possible. Now this is more of a nitpick because any good trainer knows what they are going to use most likely, but this next bit is unforgiveable. The timer will tick down even as animations play, and the terra raid pokemon has the unfortunate ability to do multiple things in succession before you are able to choose your next attack. These things include, using a move, removing any debufs, removing all YOUR buffs, putting its shield up, and stealing your terra orb charge. Oh, and the move if these animations are slow enough can cause them to use multiple moves back to back before you get to do anything. Oh what's that? you wanted to choose your attack? Well better wait 30 seconds for these animations to happen. And you wanted them to get one attack in for each one you deal? oh buddy, good luck with that because they might, idk double moonblast with double stat drop ya, or dragondance earthquake ya or my personal favorite, here have a yawn and then do some shit like coil or amnesia. So not only does this system eliminate any fairness in an attack for attack based game it just straight up ignores it. Also, want to terrastalize? well there's 20 seconds off your timer as you have to sit through the whole god dang animation.

5. And here we are long last at #5, and is somewhat related to the issue with #2. See, you really really need to resist the opponents attacks while at the same time having good offensive capability that matches the terra type needed to shield break them. Now there are 18 pokemon types in the game, with approximately 324 different type combinations when you take into consideration dual typing. Now not all dual types exists, so lets just call it an even 300, or even better lets just half it to make the point. 150 type combonations you gotta plan for defensively. You know what, multiple types will fill the defensive combinations for multiple types so lets bring that even lower to 50 different combinations that you got to plan for. Now these 50 pokemon that will cover every possible type you need to fight also need to have the correct terra type to fight them. For the sake of expediency, the average number of weaknesses a type possesses is about 3. So, to have all your bases covered to bring the best pokemon for the fight, you would need about 150 different pokemon to fulfill all these roles, and then multiply that number by 2 for special vs physicals users. so...300 different pokemon to cover those bases for perfect coverage. Obviously this is a bit ridiculous in practice, so when someone says, why don't you have that perfect typing for this specific pokemon that is why, i don't have 300 available box spots in my pc. So, they only thing to do realistically is try to get the best defensive coverage you can while still having an offensive threat, which 90% of the pokemon in the game currently currently just don't have. Don't require that level of perfection for content that is pre-post game. Heck don't require that level of perfection except for the hardest of lvl 6 raids. (Rip future charizard attempts)

So yes, this was long but I think I've pretty much covered the biggest issues with the lvl 5 raids. Overpowered stats, ridiculous mechanics for attacking, bad interval shenanigans, and many more.

My closing argument is this, I've seen idk how many people just bring 4 legendaries to these raids either on youtube or twitch or whatever to win these raids. They all use metal sound/screech to lower defenses, buff the attack then use the collision course/electric drift move to do big damage. So my point is this, If you need bring a big legendary stat-stick and win most raids regardless of typing with this strategy while almost all other Pok√©mon struggle to do good even with proper typing and stats, then that is either dogshit game balance or dogshit gameplay.

P.S Protip, if there is a ditto and you are hosting, dont select a stupid legendary for it to turn into, pick a stupid lvl 5 magicarp with splash so people can win the fight in 10 seconds.

FIFA,"FUT Black Friday ""review""","It was my first black friday on FUT. Everyone was talking about this event, I went fully into it and in my opinion it was very underwhelming. 

A part from the pack weight that many pointed out, that is ""subjective"" and we can discuss in other post (I can post my horrifying results), let's look at the offer of the event:

There where no discounts on FIFA Points. What would it cost to EA to give something like a 30-50%, like every company does? Make it even only for a single purchase.

There were no discounts on packs, but there were more available packs than usual. Basically, targeting addiction and whales.

There were some special packs (star player and 100 player) but they were very expensive and the items were untradeable. In the end, I would not say there was a single worthy pack apart from the 10 coins one (which at the end for 99% people was still a joke).

On top of this, they released tons of SBC, and if you look carefully none of these was actually a good deal but rather a way to waste 11 cards to get 1 or 2 back, hoping for a big pull, and then go back to the store to buy more packs to not ""miss out"" on the next ""big deal"".

pokemon,Was the ‚ÄúPorygon Seizure‚Äù situation used to demonize pokemon?,"So I‚Äôm sure a lot of you long term fans are familiar with this whole event during the 90s. For those who don‚Äôt know, basically an episode aired where pikachu uses thunderbolt on a porygon resulting in red and blue flashing on the screen about 12 time in 6 seconds and reports say that it caused over 12000 kids to be sent to the hospital for blurred vision and/or convulsions.

Now I randomly was thinking about this so I tried to find some articles about this episode. Firstly it is really hard to find any Japanese articles about it were impossible to find about it. Now I‚Äôm not the greatest at research like this but usually it‚Äôs pretty easy to find articles about a local issue let alone something that was this huge.

Next a lot of articles call out the fact that the numbers reported would be extremely unlikely. In average 1 in 100 people have symptoms of epilepsy. The numbers reported are about 10 times bigger than thst number.

So I was thinking. Do you think it‚Äôs possible that this event was super overblown in the us simply to try and dissuade people from trusting pokemon? The 90s were a weird time where anything could be demonized like dnd.",CallOfDuty,pos

The only cure is to have Mbappe, Neymar or CR7 in the attack. These players do move better but also make those dumb runs frequently. I guess EA just made no effort into working on this aspect this year. 

I also don‚Äôt understand why we have manual runs functionality when the opponent can clearly track down the player indicator. If we didn‚Äôt see the opponent‚Äôs indicator, the idea of manual runs would have a better success.",FIFA,pos

[https://i.imgur.com/SxvxbqU.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/SxvxbqU.mp4)

I have learned to dribble a bit with him, even on world class squad battles against reasonable teams I can get around them now. His pace is great, his runs are perfect unless you're getting massive server lag.

I have literally played him anywhere in front half, CAM, RW, LW, CF or Striker, he does it all. Can also score some great headers.

Using shield then a cheeky skill move out of it is so OP with him, he is strong enough to hold off any defender, get's that little break and you're gone, he even avoids Kante's pocket and Varane's bus..

Anyone thinking of doing him, I hope EA release some Upgrades so you can get some fodder, he is worth every penny.

I use Engine on him, which is the logical choice.

Between WL, Rivals and Squad Battles on WC or Legendary, he has played 208 Games for 341 goals and 353 Assists, I usually partner him with Daglish, together they are perfect.

I played Bamba TOTS in same role as him and to check stats out. Bamba 60 games, 53 goals and 31 assists. Clear difference between the cards.

So get him guys, he is fun, FIFA is nearing the end, so who cares!!!",FIFA,neg

pokemon,Field Effects,"If you've played the fan game Pokemon Reborn, you're familiar with the idea of Field Effects which they implemented into their game.

Basically, there are various ""fields"" for certain boss fights (mostly gym battles) but a few other situations as well. Which reflect the environment you're battling in.  It's sort of taking the idea of things like sandstorm, rain, blizzards, etc and super charging them.

For example, the electric gym takes place in a factory, on the factory field. This field makes electric moves stronger, weakens some types of other moves, and even amplifies the effects of some moves, like doubling the power increase from moves like charge.

However, fields can also be nullified with certain moves.  I'm pretty sure the factory field can be smashed by using a specific move like rock slide and a few others.  So you can either try to use the field to your advantage, try to overpower it, or try to nullify it.

This makes the gym challenges much more difficult, requiring actual strategy to beat... it also makes certain TMs you might not normally use more useful.

Pokemon Reborn had TONS of fields... all with unique rules and effects.

I would love to see something like this introduced in generation 9.

**070 - Weepinbell**

Pitcher plants are really cool in real life. They're elegant, beautiful, and viciously creepy the more you think about them. If I were to be designing a pitcher plant based Pok√©mon, I'd probably go for something alluring yet obviously evil: perhaps regal or siren like. I'm envisioning something along the various design lines of Queen Sectonia from Kirby, with some pretty gradients, maybe an ability that changes it's typing from Grass/Fairy to Grass/Dark after the first hit. 

What I wouldn't do is design a Pok√©mon so hideous that no bug would ever want to go within 10 feet of it, yet alone into it's mouth. Also - this massive monstrosity doesn't even bait prey with scents like a pitcher plant, apparently it's a camoflauged ambush predator! You're telling me this gargantuan monstrosity with a mouth wider than my ego is a stealth expert? Yeah, pull the other one.

Weepinbell is wasted potential for a really interesting real world phenomena that has pretty much nothing interesting to it in gameplay or lore. It's bizarre looking gonk that fails to be either intimidating or cute, and it transitions from the weird an zany Bellsprout to somehow managing to top itself in hideousness. And at least Bellsprout had a tower, for... some reason. Anyway, I won't be hesitating to put Weepinbell down in **F Tier.** I actively dislike looking at this thing and I honestly can't find any redeeming qualities that would raise it higher, without imagining how much cooler they'd be elsewhere. If you actively like Weepinbell, I'd LOVE to hear your thoughts on why in the comments, because I can't find it on my own.

\----------------------------------------------

Well, got this one out of the way much earlier than yesterday! Getting back to schedule. And in less than half an hour, we'll probably be introduced to a new ghost type Pokemon as well! Here's hoping I like it more than Weepinbell. Either way, I'll see you tomorrow!

GTA,Does GTA have a voice actor problem?,"https://youtu.be/s00Y8_Ur1dg

Two years ago this video got put out and it outlined the poor treatment/compensation of the voice actors for CJ and Niko Bellic (around 50k each for their work on the gta games with no further royalties) - Rockstar‚Äôs attitude (as well as the gaming industry in general) has shifted towards better treatment of voice actors. However, Steven Ogg has recently caused a bit of a stir. 

I really like Steven Ogg - I enjoyed his minor roles in Westworld, The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul and I have no doubt that his role of Trevor Phillips likely influenced him getting larger roles. Yet, Steven Ogg decided to lash out at a fan who requested a Cameo from Trevor, only to accept said paid request and go on a rant about acting, all the while driving around in sunglasses and freshly dyed bleach blonde hair, Vinewood style. 

Steven Ogg can do what he likes but trying to completely downplay his role of Trevor as a ‚Äòcartoon character‚Äô and then accept the money for the Cameo made him come across as an asshole. 

However, the cameo included details about the GTA6 leak, which was ridiculous to ask someone who worked with Rockstar to mention and I feel like the cameo was made for content purposes. Then when you look at the social media accounts of the likes of Young Melaay (CJ) and Steven Ogg, they are quite often mobbed with constant gta references, so I could see why there is a breaking point for these actors but equally they are part of one of the biggest franchises in the world? I suppose the likeness for Steven Ogg is hard for him to shake. Some actors like Norman Reedus are completely cool about it though, so I think it comes down to the actor themselves.

I have a life outside of the games, quite a lot of it actually. It's a lot easier and much more interesting to train up a bunch of Pok√©mon together. It allows you to see if teams work and fix what doesn't without dedicating a then-unreasonable amount of time into it.

In every AC game both orders have their ups and downs. Much like how in Rogue the Assassins look like the bad guys and in AC 2 (these are the only ac games i've played lol) the Templars look like the REALLY bad guys. But they've always had the same objective, just with different execution. Why not just unify? Keep your beliefs, sure, but play along together. Assassins don't go into Templar stuff, Templars don't go into Assassin stuff. Everyone gets a fair share.

Animus tech is shared to preserve all the past memories of important figures, the pieces of Eden are left alone, yadda yadda yadda.

I remember that I did have the First Order Star Destroyer #75190 and Kylo Ren‚Äôs Starfighter #75179. 

So that explains Kylo and the troopers I think, but unsure where I got Rey, Yoda, and is that Po? Also unsure of the other random lol.

pokemon,Do ya'll miss when Pokemon didn't have so many characters? Or do you prefer it?,"I've started playing through Moon again as my latest game and going through the games really slow and text heavy opening, I had a brain wave and realised why all modern games feel like such a slog to get through sometimes. There's too many characters!

Think back to the Kanto games, there was: MC, Blue, Oak, Giovanni and then brief side characters like Bill, Mr Fuji etc

Nowadays Pokemon games jam pack their stories full of characters, all of which need to be talking and moving and all sorts. The 3ds games are grand examples of this because you have:

X/Y - MC, Sycamore, Tierno, Trevor, Serena/Calum, Shauna, Lysandre and heaps of side characters (Diantha, Korrina, Parfum Palace characters, Flare Admins, etc)

S/M - MC, Hau, Lillie, Kikui, Gladion, Guzma, Plumeria, Lusamine, Ultra Recon Squad in US/UM and countless side characters/cameos (Colress, Dexio, Kahunas, etc)

Personally I feel like the games have become too busy over time, because there's so many characters that as the games have developed now all need to be involved more with the story in whatever capacity, you have to sit through heaps and heaps of dialogue so everyone gets their say in. I've also found in S/M specifically, characters love to move around lots which always seems to slow things down further.

I think in some cases it can work to the games advantage having more dialogue and characters. S/V I feel actually did quite a good job dealing with this issues as while there are lots of characters, a lot of the dialogue is optional (talking about the school sections) and in the main sections of the game, dialogue is restricted to a smaller group of main characters (Nemona, Arven, Penny and Clavell). Definitely still has its issues though, especially with the Starfall Street storyline (all be it that was actually a good story for once).

The Gen 5 games also managed to keep quite a sizable cast whilst telling a good story, mostly because characters like Cheren, Bianca, Colress and Juniper mostly appear alone or with 1 other character, which is usually either brief of has its pacing balanced with a battle. Hugh and N do talk a considerable amount more, but thats mostly due to the having the story more focused on them.

Does seem like a long ramble but I'd love to hear your opinions, do Pokemon have their characters talking more than they need to? Should the cast of characters be cut back down in the future or is this just how the games have changed overtime?",FinalFantasy,neg

Or when Tim Cahill's WCH card has him brandishing the Everton logo, but has MLS league links. 

Andrea Pirlo is also not in a Milan Kit. 

Suker's description is still not written correctly, implying Croatia's best result at a world cup is 3rd, when they finished second in 2018.

After watching the DLC announcement Im starting to get more interested in the lore, the ""disk"" pokemon is finally revealed and may explain terastilization a bit more.

I also did a count of my shinies and thought I had only gotten 100 unique shinies, despite the shiny count saying 101. I went through the pokedex and looked at all of the shinies I had caught and realised that for someone reason after catching a shiny continental form vivillon, the pokedex showed both the continental and fancy shiny vivillon forms.

pokemon,Do you like scarlet and violet being open world?,"Saw mixed opinions about this so here‚Äôs a poll!

Myself, I‚Äôd say I wasn‚Äôt too fond of Scarlet/violet being so OW in the beginning since it felt overwhelming but after playing for a little while you definitely get used to it and it is DEFINITELY more fun once you unlock koraidon/miraidon‚Äôs literal ability to climb walls, surf etc‚Ä¶ everything becomes so much more accessible. 

ALL that said I also don‚Äôt know if I would want this to become a thing for every game. I think a lot of past game felt open world-y while still being more linear‚Ä¶So I would pick option 3 on this poll.

 I definitely think you can strike a balance between handholding and ‚Äòopen worldness‚Äô and currently I personally don‚Äôt want this degree of OW‚Äôness to be a thing for every game, but it really has  been awesome to experience really want to say that again. I guess it‚Äôs just a one time thing for me.

That said‚Ä¶if this kind of OW‚Äôness IS going to be a thing from now on I think having a better map and better navigation overall would be better. As of now I personally wouldn‚Äôt want S/V‚Äôs *specific* brand of open worldness to become a staple in other Pok√©mon games. It needs some more tweaking first‚Ä¶then maybe. Definitely open to the idea providing execution is a little better second time around. So (again) going to go with option 3!

We‚Äôve never seen who his father is within the entire anime but I‚Äôm sure he would be proud. He lives with his mom and mr mime but he woke up late and got a pikachu who never listened to him. They both went to a Pok√©mon centre and fought team rocket who wanted to capture his pikachu. It‚Äôs been 26 years and none of them have aged at all.

Onto the theory

Jessie and James are ash‚Äôs aunt and uncle, mr mime is ash‚Äôs dad and ash is on some sort of drugs which keep him from aging.",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,Let‚Äôs talk about the Box ‚ÄúLegendaries‚Äù of this gen,"Can we really categorize Koraidon/Miraidon as legendary Pok√©mon? They are basically the paradox forms of Cyclizar and that‚Äôs about it. While they do have legendary like stats, I feel that that‚Äôs not the only thing required to be a legendary. A legendary Pok√©mon should be unique and one of a kind with some mythical mystical backstory associated with them, while with Korai/Mirai you already get two in one playthrough and it is also stated during the story that while Professor Sada only managed to get two of them, the time from which they belong was apparently full of them, not really all that‚Ä¶legendary if you ask me. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, they are really great Pok√©mon both design and statwise but they aren‚Äôt in the ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù Pok√©mon category. Hell even weaker legendaries like the Lake Trio or the Kanto birds are more of Legends than these guys lorewise. The only ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù Pok√©mon that K&amp;M can be compared to are Solgaleo and Lunala but even those to had tons of lore about them, not to mention their ability to personify the sun and moon. K&amp;M have no such ‚ÄúEnvironment altering‚Äù abilities or even lore like other legendaries have.

TL,DR: Koraidon/Miraidon are too ‚ÄúCommon‚Äù and loreless to be considered legendary Pok√©mon.

Edit: Adding a few more points.
1. The argument that they are from the future or past is moot because it holds true for all the other paradox mons as well
2. They didn‚Äôt outright kill the Professor. It was more of a freak accident.
3. It is never stated as to why the professor did not/could not bring in more than two of the species but it can very well be assumed that they died before they could properly explore that timeline.",FIFA,pos

1. I would love to see Mega evolutions back. I miss them it gave me more options for odd team building.

2.  If we get Kalos back I hope for Battle Frontier as I recall X&amp;Y were the first installments with Battle Frontier under construction. So maybe it would feel like we're in a future Kalos.

3. I hope we get another Trio of legendaries. Not sure as to what of? Maybe fish or bugs or even Pokemon based off natural disasters. With lore attached to them. The Legendary dogs will always stand out to me due to there backgrounds.

4. Cosmetics the school uniforms are such a let down. I'm jealous of people that have violet as it looks easier to build outfits. Orange is a cool color but it goes with almost nothing. 

5. More battle options or formats in Multiplayer idk if GF could do it but it would be wild to see like a random battle team option as a weekly thing. That fully randomizes your team and held items.

pokemon,"What if you got to fight Calaba, Iscan and Palina in Legends Arceus? What do you think their teams would be?","Just something that came to mind. They‚Äôre the only wardens of the clans that you never fight in either the main story or post game so I‚Äôm curious about what Pokemon you think would fit them. You only really have to give a team of 3 since the clans don‚Äôt seem to go any larger than that.

For Calaba, I‚Äôve heard a theory that she‚Äôs related to Mina (the fairy captain from the Alola games) but not sure if I see it. I guess you could give her some fairy types like a Mr Mime or Alolan Ninetales to make a connection more obvious but I‚Äôm more considering Pok√©mon that are dual normal type like her Bibarel and the noble Ursaluna. So that would be Pokemon like Staraptor, Wyrdeer or Hisuian Zoroark. I‚Äôd probably go wo Wyrdeer and Staraptor since she‚Äôs getting on in age and they can help her get around (also her using a Wyrdeer to battle to purposefully annoy the diamond clan in her youth seems both funny and in character to me). So for me, her team would be Bibarel, Staraptor and Wyrdeer.

For Iscan, he has no shown Pok√©mon so you can be a bit creative. I‚Äôd personally go with Hisuian Quilfish/Overquil since it‚Äôs a water dwelling Pokemon that deals with the ghost types he hates. Also maybe give him a male Basculin due to his lord and a Floatzel for cool points. So, yeah, Overquil, Male Basculegion and Floatzel are his team.

Lastly for Palina, her bulbapedia page says the other Hisuian Growlithe is hers so I guess maybe giving her another Fire or Rick type would work? Maybe Ninetales since it‚Äôs an alpha on firespit island and Vulpix can be caught nearby where you first meet her. For the last Pokemon I‚Äôm thinking a female Basculin/Basculegion so she can get to firespit island and as a nod to her and Iscan‚Äôs relationship. So her team would be Hisuian Arcanine, Ninetales and Female Basculegion.

Those were my ideas for their teams, what about the rest of you? What would you make them?",FIFA,pos

FIFA,Possible explanation for the stat nerf issue,"Seeing a lot of ‚Äútinfoil head‚Äù theories about EA secretly patching items on purpose and cards weeks after release feeling different I thought I want to share a possible reasoning.

First: why do cards suddenly feel worse?

Simple answer: Power curve. The day your MOTM Di Maria comes out his stats might be top class, but just since release we had multiple releases of items with equally or better stats. Secondly - live tunings that affect certain strengths of players. If dribbling for example gets patched it of course affects a player which main strength is dribbling 

So what could be the reason? Well, if we think back immediately after the release of the centurion cards it was obvious that the face card stats don‚Äôt match the in game values. A potential reason could be that the calculation of the stats is the reason for this and some kind of hard coding has been used to bypass the in game stat calculation. This theory especially gets strengthened with the timing of the issue, since the nerf applied at the same time a live tuning did happen. Meaning that this could potentially have been overwritten some hard codings that have been applied. 

I think in this case we should (as hard as it sometimes is) give EA the benefit of the doubt",FIFA,pos

pokemon,It's a bit scary knowing Pokemon are able to come and go in and out of their Poke Balls AT WILL,"I've seen it a few times in the anime as well as the games. Commonly with Misty's Psyduck, Brock's Croagunk, Ash's Oshawott as well as your ride Koraidon/Koraidon in Scarlet and Violet.

But if Pokemon were real, it would be frightening to know that a powerful creature that you can carry around in your pocket, can simply come out on its own if it wants to and do whatever it pleases.

Or if in a situation where you need your Pokemon the most, if it's not in the mood to act, it can simply be like ""nope"" and go right back in its Pokeball.

This also reminds me of how in Legends Arceus, Pokeballs then were only a recent discovery and very few people wielded them. The term Pokemon ""Wielder"" seems more interesting than ""Trainer"" as in both PLA and SV, it's implied that back in ancient times, only a select few number of people were brave and skilled enough to wield Pokemon. 

Heck, back in Hisui, most people didn't even keep their Pokemon in Pokeballs and never even gave commands to their Pokemon in battle, but trust their Pokemon to act on their own.",pokemon,pos

assassinscreed,Some questions about Valhalla,"So i had a couple of questions about Valhalla. I've been playing for around 60 hours and im power 230, and I'm on eurvicscire arc. I'm currently using full mythical hidden ones set ( half maxed) raider axe maxed, and raven clan shield which is almost full

1. is raider axe good for late game - end?  I kind of just kept upgrading it and right now its maxed out, at like 116 damage. It's quite weak compared to Varin's axe or some hammers/spears I found, but it's fast and it's fun to use. So is it work keeping or should I downgrade it and do something else?
2. How do I increase speed of weapons? I put runes on some, and I upgrade the skills manually, but I don't notice a difference. Also I don't know what I did but somehow a lot of my weapons just randomly got +1 speed, like in the base stats. It used to be 54 speed but all of a sudden I checked my inventory and it was 55.
3. Is there a specific weapon combo that's like the sweet spot between a barbaric and an assassin playstyle? I mainly play stealth but I sometimes get forced into situations where I have to just fight(like raids or taking castles). I also hate slow weapons, but the fast ones are all weak. Is there like a good weapon combo that works for both?

Change skin tone 

Add different pixelated accessories 

Different types of outfits/armor/helmets depending on the character w/full range color palettes

Being a creature instead of a human example would be like a monk with horns or a warrior that‚Äôs an Elf. Lots of possible combinations 

Setting their sound effects when they attack or die etc.


These mods would make FF1 where the characters are reflections of the player, much more personalized and fun!

assassinscreed,"For people that played Valhalla, when does it get good?","I've been playing the RPG games recently, I started Origins back when it was released but I never finished it. A couple of months ago, I finished it and I liked it. I played Odyssey and it's fucking incredible besides a few issues here and there. I started Valhalla yesterday, and the first cinematic is way too long (I get why, building the scene), but Goddamn it made me bored just slowly walking around. Then the cinematic when Eivor is freeing himself from the shackles was also long, then you have to go to that warehouse thing where your friends are held captive and that took ages, then you have to fight people and your allies are just standing there while you fight them. Combat is slow as fuck and annoying, so I quit the game. I began again today, and it's just slow.

I'm just wondering if I should stick with it or give up. When does it actually become enjoyable for people that liked the game or even people that hated it? It's frustrating because I wanted to like it because of the brutal nature of Vikings and Valhalla and the cinematics, but I don't know. Odyssey was perfect imo as it fixed stuff from Origins that I absolutely hated, the theme is great, Kassandra is amazing as a protagonist.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,The mythological origins of one of the most bizarre new Water-type Pok√©mon,"One of the most divisive Pok√©mon from the latest games has been Finizen. You probably encountered it, thought something like, ""Oh, cute, they finally made a dolphin Pok√©mon! It's a bit mundane, though, isn't it?"", evolved it into Palafin thinking, ""WTF? It just gets a heart on its chest?"", and had an even bigger WTF reaction upon seeing Palafin's Hero Form, which activates when switching out. Today I'm going to explain how the idea for this bizarre Pok√©mon came to be.

First of all, it didn't take long for anyone to catch on to the fact that this is Pok√©mon's take on a superhero. Under normal circumstances, it can blend in perfectly with the average Finizen, hence why it looks almost identical to its pre-evolution; but when there's trouble afoot, it switches to its Hero Form off-screen looking like a completely different Pok√©mon. Think of it as Clark Kent entering a phone booth and coming out as Superman. Speaking of Superman, the OG superhero's debut was in 1938, and it just so happens that Finizen evolves at a minimum of level 38. That could just be a coincidence, but it wouldn't be the most obscure reference in a Pok√©mon's stats or evolution method.

But what's the connection between dolphins and superheroes, anyway? The most popular explanation is that dolphins have been known to save people on their own accord, which is a very good guess, but there is another inspiration at play here that I haven't seen anyone else bring up: the **encantado** (not to be confused with the Disney movie of a similar name).

In South American folklore, an encantado or boto encantado (enchanted dolphin) is an Amazon river dolphin with supernatural powers and a utopian underwater realm, known as the Encante, to call home. When the sun goes down, there is a possibility that an encantado will leave the Encante (and its brethren, often against their wishes for it to stay) to assume the form of a handsome young man with a blowhole concealed by a white hat. Unlike Palafin, the dolphin-turned-man then goes off to parties where it can seduce women, impregnate them, and sometimes kidnap them before hurrying back to the Encante unseen to become a dolphin again. They may also kidnap the resulting children or simply anyone who can keep them company to take to the Encante... which is said to be a paradise, yet no human ever comes it back from alive. In some isolated parts of the Amazon, this myth is still used as a cover story for unwanted pregnancies; children with unknown fathers are called ""filhos de boto"", meaning ""children of the dolphin"".

There are several other powers that the encantado is also said to have, but the rest don't seem to have any connection with Palafin; one of them is to control storms, which could be why Palafin learns Rain Dance through TM, but that's already a common move among Water-type Pok√©mon. Obviously, some parts of the encantado myth couldn't make it into Pok√©mon without giving the game an M rating, so Game Freak adapted it into something else that secretly transforms by night.

Tl;dr: Palafin is based on superheroes and legendary shapeshifting dolphins.",pokemon,neg

pokemon,I absolutely adore this game (light spoilers ahead),"This is going to be a positive post. I will talk about personal gripes with the game, but I won‚Äôt talk about performance and graphics and shit since that‚Äôs been beaten to death and I don‚Äôt care for that discourse (plus I had no issues aHA!). Also THIS IS MY OPINION!

I loved this game so so much, Omigod!!! Honestly from minute 1 of loading up the game, I was excited, and that excitement only went up as I played more of it. First of all, Paldea is beautiful. The vibrancy, different ecosystems, the live Pok√©mon walking about and interacting with the environment, how expansive it is. It takes what I loved about the PLA maps and stitches them together really well imo. Plus the overworld music for each area is paired so well, there is not one song in this game I‚Äôm sick of. Don‚Äôt even get me started on Area Zero, UGH, so beautiful and otherworldly in looks and music. On the topic of music, every composer who did the songs in this game deserve a raise cuz it was phenomenal. That Elite 4 music is my personal fav. 

‚ÄòMon designs in this game range from hilarious (in a good way) to beautiful. The starters are all so cool, and them all having a theme of being performers (magician, dancer, singer) is really cool. The new mons i fell in love with were def Baxcalibur, Ceruledge, Tinkaton (usual suspects), but also Tandemous, Kilowattrel, Spidops, Rabsca, and even Dudunsparce. Plus almost all the paradox Pokemon (future and past) are all cool and or well designed. 

My final team ended up being Quaquaval, Ceruledge, Kilowattrel, Krookodile, Baxcalibur, and Tinkaton.

We all know this, character designs, possibly the hottest overall gen to exist. Rika is giving Karen some major competition as my PKMN crush. But seriously, really well designed characters. The personality of the major characters themselves like Clive, Clavell, Cassieopia, Penny, Cassieopia, Nemona, Arven, Turo, etc... I really like them all a lot. Nemona is probably my favorite rival in PKMN to date, and she does that competitive rivalry thing a lot LOT better than Hop and Barry, whom I both found just obnoxious and annoying. Arven being fleshed out with his story and seeing his bombastic personality be more of an endearing trait than an annoyance was so so nice. And Penny was a curveball for me as seeing her story with Team Star and how she wanted the best for them, and that final scene where they all came out was super heartwarming. Plus it was really cool to have a four-man party with the 3 of them in Area Zero, though I wished we had to do some sort of Tera Raid style battle with the 4 of us, that wouldve been sick. 

The story in this game is so nice, and so beautifully presented. You going through the pokemon league like past games, but also getting a close connection with Arven and his story with his father and the Mabostiff and how that plays into his emotional loneliness almost is beautiful, and honestly made me cry. Figuring out a sort of history of the academy with Team Star and how they sort of failed of creating a safe environment for some students and how these delinquents were almost vigilante-like in protecting some of those bullied students was oddly heartwarming as well. And then ofc with Area Zero and a deeper dive into Arven and the Professors story as well as the origin of Miraidon/Koraidon was so cool and beautifully shown with how nice Area Zero is. Plus that twist, HO my god did that send chills down my spine from how crazy and badass the whole final sequence was. Seriously, if you haven't started the Area Zero storyline, DO IT DO IT DO IT! Plus having that attachment with Miraidon/Koraidon the whole game and how he's been your companion the whole time makes that final moment with it that much more powerful. 

This was a very long post, but idc, I just love this game to bits, and is probably in my top 3 pokemon games of all time behind ORAS and PLA. This game deserves a lot of love, and I hope the bugs get patched out and fixed so that people can enjoy this beauty without problems in the future.",pokemon,pos

FIFA,WL Rank 1 &amp; Elite Division 4-3-3 (2) Formation Guide,"# Intro

In real life the 4-3-3 is arguably the most dominant formation amongst top teams. We have managers such as Pep, Klopp, Sarri, Ancelotti and Spalletti using it succesfully in various ways, so why is it so underused in FIFA? From what i've learned it's because it isn't as simple or as direct as most two striker (including striker + CAM) formations. I've wanted to make a fun and competitive way to play the 4-3-3 and now i think i've found it. Although this is a guide for the 4-3-3 (2) most of the instructions and tactics are also usable with the other 4-3-3 variations.

I will just use this intro to get ahead of some of the comments i usually see on most formation/tactic guides.

* *Are these tactics usable on new/old gen?* \- I've mostly used them on old gen, but i've given them a fair try on new gen and YES they do work.
* *A good player can make every formation work. -* This guide doesn't guarantee any performance improvement, but rather offers a different (and more fun imo) approach to the game.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Tactics

**Formation: 4-3-3(2)**

**Defence**

* Defensive style: Balanced
* Width: 40
* Depth: 60

Change the depth to whatever suits you. I just use 60 as i feel it has a good balance.

**Offence**

* Build Up Play: Balanced
* Chance Creation: Forward Runs
* Width: 1
* Players In Box: 4

The 1 width was my attempt to make the formation a bit more narrow, but it didn't really work as intended.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Instructions &amp; Player Types

**GK**

* Instructions: None
* Player Type: I've used IF Szczesny since he came out in TOTW 2, so i really don't know how much of a difference goalkeepers make. Use who you like.

**CBs**

* Instructions: None
* Player Type: As with basically every other tactic you'll face a lot of counters so get some fast CBs. I've used Hero Cordoba and Baby Maldini for a while and they've been my best investment yet.

**LB**

* Instructions: Stay back - Overlap - Conservative interceptions
* Player Type: This player will mostly stay back and become the 3rd CB when attacking, but don't be afraid to use him offensively when given the opportunity. I would recommend someone with good enough defending to be used in a back 3 (RTTK Gosens for me).

**RB**

* Instructions: Balanced - Overlap
* Player Type: The offensive fullback. This player will add some width and diversity to the attack. Get someone with good dribbling, crossing and some decent stamina if you don't want to sub him too early. I used OTW Dest, but there's definitely room for improvement here.

**CDM**

* Instructions: Stay back - Cover Center - Deep Lying Playmaker
* Player Type: As the DLP this player needs to be good at both short and long range passing while also being a decent defender. When attacking this player will have most of the responsibility for recycling the ball safely, so he also needs to be comfortable on the ball. Here i think RTTK Bennacer is king as he possesses a bit of everthing i've mentioned, but i could definitely also see a bigger DM do a good job in this role.

**LCM**

* Instructions: Get Forward - Cover Wing
* Player Type: The offensive CM. This guy will act as a hybrid between af forward and a midfielder. So basically get someone who you could see yourself using at CAM or just a CM who's very good offensively. He'll be making a lot of runs into the box so it's a good idea to have someone who has good finishing and a good WF. I've been using WC Nakata lately and he's been amazing. While his defensive stats are actually decent you don't really have to think about the defensive stats of this player too much as you'll be defending with five midfielders.

**RCM**

* Instructions: Balanced - Cover Wing
* The Box-To-Box midfielder. This is the all-rounder. He'll have to do a bit of everything, so get someone as close to Gullit-gang as possible. I cheap constant performer here for me is IF Barella, but there are plenty of other good players to fill this role.

**LW/RW**

* Instructions: Come Back On Defence - Free Roam - Get Into Box For Cross
* Player Type: These two players need good pace and dribbling. They'll be running in behind a lot, but they'll also caught in tight spaces. Shooting and passing is also important, but not as much as the other two stats. I've been pairing RB Insigne and OOP Chiesa for a while now and they're perfect as wingers in this formation.

**ST**

* Instructions: Come Back On Defence
* Player Type: For this position i don't have a specific type of player. I believe both bigger and smaller players are usable here. I've mostly used EOAE Higuain and he's done a good job. I will add that a good WF is preferable to have.

All instructions can of course be mirrored if it suits your selection of players better.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Gameplay tips

**Defending counters**

* When losing the ball you'll most likely have three defenders and a CDM to defend the counter with. Here it's important to NOT drag your defenders out of position unless it's absolutely necessary. Use your CDM to press and try to stall the attack until your defence settles.

**Defending when settled**

* When the team is defensively settled it should look like a 4-5-1/4-1-4-1.
* If your opponent hasn't gone past your midfield you should do everything to get the ball. Use your midfielders and striker to press the ball holder and cut off passing options. With five midfielders you should have plenty of options to press with. And don't forget to use second man press (R1/RB).
* If/When your opponent breaches your midfield you shouldn't switch to your defenders immediately. Instead drag your midfielders back and press from behind. As with defending counters, you should only use your defenders when you're forced to.

**Counter attacking**

* When counter attacking in a 4-3-3 it's important to master the wingers. Here there are two key moves to get the most out your wingers.
* Firstly, if you want to get the ball in behind to a winger use direct lofted through balls (L1+R1+Triangle / LB+RB+Y). Grounded through balls are mostly useless in this game so don't waste good counter attacking opportunities with those.
* Secondly, you want to use creative runs. In a 4-3-3 the wingers are mostly positioned very wide and therefore also make runs in the wide areas. This is good in some situations, but you'll want to add some diversity to your counter attacking methods. You do a creative run by activating a manual run (L1/LB) and afterwards flicking the right stick in the direction you want to player to run (might be a good idea to look up a tutorial on YT). Here i recommend making runs inwards as you'll get more players into central areas. If you can't find a good pass to the running player, don't worry. Creative runs will often leave space open for other attacking players and the wingers will stay central for a while afterwards, so there are more benefits to creative runs than just getting the ball in behind.

**Attacking a settled defence**

* It's never easy attacking a compact defence, but these tactics have some different ways to get past your past your opponents defenders.
* The first method has a lot to do with ""Forwards Runs"". When in possession of the ball on the edge of your opponents box you'll almost always have one to two players running in behind. You can approach this in two ways. You can either try to lob (L1+Triangle/LB+Y) the ball over the defenders or utilise the space left open by the running attacker. Both ways are viable, but i would especially try to get used to lobbing the ball over the defenders as it's really effective.
* The second method is getting the ball wide and either cross it or recycle it back centrally to create more space. Crossing is decent with this formation as you have a winger or a midfielder at the back post.
* The third method is to recycle the ball for at bit and be sure to slow the tempo down. Then when you're in a comfortable position with for example your CDM, you can try to speed up the tempo and ping-pong it through the defence. The last method here might be the most underrated as a lot players tend to get impatient when attacking, so slowing down might help you see opportunities that you would've missed otherwise.

That's it. Hope some of you will get some joy out of this guide!",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Joining Tera Raid's Online shouldn't feel this fustrating,"I can't help but feel like Game Freak have taken a step back with their matchmaking system for Raids in Pokemon. 

Don't get me wrong Sw/Sh Online most definitely had it's flaws but I felt like at least with that game I could refresh every few seconds when it was clear as day that the lobbies were full and even when the lobbies were full and I tried to join it would notify my instantly instead of connecting for 30 seconds to a minute straight just to tell me I can't join and by then the rest of the lobbies within that page are most likely filled up, so you're far better off waiting the extra 1-2 minutes for the refresh option.

I feel like I spend more time looking for a lobby than I actually do playing raids &amp; I just wish they kept the old system from Sw/Sh where you could refresh more frequently and weren't limited to this 8 per lobby system.

I get there's probably discord servers out there, reddit's out there that make it easier to join with the Link Code option but the truth is it shouldn't be this fustrating in the first place for someone who just casually wants to sit down and play a few raids.

The game follows the story of Alexei Ivanov, a young KGB agent who discovers that he is part of a secret order of assassins known as the Brotherhood.

As the game begins, Alexei is tasked with infiltrating a top-secret CIA facility in Langley, Virginia, to steal classified intelligence. However, during the mission, Alexei uncovers a conspiracy that threatens the entire world. The Templars, a shadowy organization that has been at war with the Brotherhood for centuries, are planning to trigger a global nuclear war to bring about a new world order.

Determined to stop the Templars and prevent the catastrophic consequences of their plan, Alexei must use all his skills as an assassin to track down and eliminate key members of the Templar order. Along the way, he encounters historical figures like Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and John F. Kennedy, all of whom are caught up in the complex web of Cold War politics.

As Alexei delves deeper into the conspiracy, he uncovers shocking secrets about his own past and the role that the Brotherhood has played in shaping world events. Ultimately, he must make a choice between his loyalty to his country and his duty as an assassin to protect humanity from the Templars' deadly plot.

With its mix of stealth, action, and historical intrigue, Assassin's Creed: Cold War offers players a thrilling journey through one of the most tumultuous periods of the 20th century",pokemon,neg

This concerns the leaks of which R* was the victim.

Imagine for 5 seconds that this massive content leak was a marketing technique orchestrated from A to Z by the company in order to make an unprecedented GTA 6 announcement. Indeed, several insiders inform us that the announcement of the game will be very original and that it will upset the world of video games.

For example, R* could produce a cinematic where we see the protagonists of the future hacker game and organize the robbery of the firm. I know this theory is completely crazy but I wanted to share it with you Imao

assassinscreed,"looking back, all the Odyssey hate was unjustified!","I mean the game was by far the least buggy in the new rpg trilogy. The story was also extremely good, up there with origins. The combat was the best, quests were diverse and fun, a lot of fun activities and side content, best post launch support in any game I've played.

The side characters were also extremely good. Even tho they had some goofy moments, they weren't bad.

Kassandra was also an extremely good maim character. After 380 hours I just didn't get tired of her which wasn't the case with bayek and eivor.

The world is the best in the series to me at least. One of the most beautiful open worlds

It also felt very alive with all the conquest and mercenaries roaming around

The fate of Atlantis is the best dlc in the series imo. You literally get 2 tons of content and some absolute stunning open worlds separate for the main game

My problem is the game and world itself. I absolutely hate the open world aspect of this game. It feels empty and due to no level-scaling the game itself is already telling you that there is a certain path you should follow or roll up to gym either severely over leveled or under leveled. All I want in a Pokemon game is that somewhat linear journey that I can have with my Pokemon. Not every game needs to open-world in today's day and age. 

The game does bring forth some really good designed Pokemon though. I'm at the 5th gym and about to drop the game entirely.

pokemon,"Wanted to get back into Pokemon, but all available options seem underwhelming. Advice wanted.","Dear Community,

So i got the itch to get back into pokemon. Nowadays i¬¥m mostly a PC gamer, but for nostalgic reasons i thought that it might be neat to get ¬¥an old DS and play through some of the titles i¬¥ve missed. 

Not as a major timesink, but as something i can play a couple of hours every now and then.

I stopped at Gen 3 Emerald, which i found to be amazing- There was so much to do, the game had quite some QoL and it was designed very well. Compared to Gen I and 2 everything was just so smooth and polished.

But i quickly realized the following- 

**Issue 1.)** The Nintendo (3) DS has been discontinued, and so are the old games. I can only get them used and for quite a lot of money. (150‚Ç¨+ for a 3DS and 40‚Ç¨+ For the games.)

**Issue 2.)** The latest releases have been for the switch, which i¬¥d have to buy and, apparently, are underwhelming for what they are. (Scarlet and Violet have an open world, which i¬¥ve wanted for a long time, but apparently are quite empty and have performance issues, the remakes of Diamond and Pearl didn¬¥t carry over any of the improvements from platinum, leaving glaring issues, and Arceus is bold, but again, empty.) At least that¬¥s the impression i¬¥ve got.

**Issue 3.)** And also- With every generation the number of new pokemon which i actually liked decreased. Generation IV was the last generation in which i liked most of the pokemon being added.

So, now i¬¥m considering my options, but all kinda seem to suck.

**Option 1.)** I shell out 200‚Ç¨+ for an Used 3DS and an old cartridge of questionable quality and authenticity, as well as life remaining, for something i only plan on playing from time to time.

**Option 2.)** I buy a Switch-Light and Scarlet/Violet for 250‚Ç¨+ in order to play a legit pokemon game, but with issues and with many pokemon which i actually don¬¥t like that much. 

I also don¬¥t plan on playing any other Switch games. 

**Option 3.)** I get some Roms and play Pokemon on my phone- But would be doing something illegal and i¬¥d miss out on the features having a legit pokemon game would entail; I would quite like to transfer pokemon between games, to trade with other players and, maybe at some point, to be able to fight other human players. In my youth i¬¥ve never got to experience the social aspect of pokemon.


So, **tld;dr**- I¬¥d basically simply would like your thoughts on the matter and especially on whether getting a switch and some/one of the games for it might be worth it, in my position.

The way i understand it, the Switch games are not horrible- But they have issues. And some glaring ones, which makes me hesistant to shell out 250‚Ç¨+ for them.",CallOfDuty,pos

I clarify starting robes because of things like the Armor of Altair, Edward's Maya armor or Shaye's Assassin Killer outfit. Those outfits are awesome in their own right, but their not the outfit that's instantly associated with the character.

Personally, my favorites are Connor's, Ezio's Revelations outfit and Jacob's first outfit.

Connor's I love because of the colors and touches of Mohawk culture he put on it, Ezio's because I think the thicker grey robes look really well on him and match the idea of him getting older and Jacob's because it's the perfect update on the ""hide in plain site"" idea, since they are modified everyday clothes from the period with a hood for when he needs to hide his face, but he mostly wears his hat.",pokemon,pos

They are the sole reason why Cold War wasn't as good as it could've been and they fumbled with Vanguard. They only have TWO years for this game even though they had 3 with Vanguard. Statistically there's just zero chance this game is going to be even decent. They only had 2 years and don't even have a good reputation of making good games. In my opinion they should be be benched.

Evidence:

* Roaring Moon's Dex entry
   * According to an article in a dubious magazine, this Pok√©mon has some connection to [a phenomenon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Evolution) that occurs in a certain region.
* The ability Parental Bond and Aerilate, is programed into the game but goes unused.
   * There are also Delta Stream, Primordial Sea and Desolant Land are programed too.
   * You can use the search bar in the boxes to search abilities, with all three on the list.
* Location, the DLC seems to be north of the region and Spain, what Paldea is based on, north of that is France, what Kalos is based on.
* New BDSP/SV style art of the mega evolutions
   * Some notable looks are different from their XY/ORAS/SM/USUM counterparts.
      * Charizard(X&amp;Y) &amp; Salamance are grounded.
      * While Gallade's stance looks different
   * It also makes no sense that the Pok√©mon Company to give manpower to something that isn't going to be used.
   * Gigantamax don't have images since Dynamax is region locked.",pokemon,neg

pokemon,"Even ignoring context, Fairy's type chart powercreeps other types.","It's been awhile since I've fully checked out the type table, and really focusing on Fairy really makes it evident just how absolutely overpowered it is even on a fundamental level. Fairy has

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at Dark and Psychic - two types whose entire point is that they have limited interactions with other types. Counting immunities like resists to make comparisons easy, each of them has only three types that can resist them, and this was considered strong enough that they needed downsides in every other department. Let's just look at the number of matchups as

Attack + / Defense + / Attack - / Defense -

Dark: +2/+3/-3/-2

Psychic: +2/+2/-3/-3

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's see Fairy

Fairy: +3/+4/-3/-2

&amp;#x200B;

This is insanely good. It has just straight up better type matchups offensively and defensively, with absolutely none of the downsides. It hits as a type designed to be offensive, while having resistances on par with some of the best defensive types. Just for context, there's only two other types with at least +4/-2 defensively, that being Water and Poison. Two types known for being fantastic defensive types, because only two weaknesses is insanely strong.

Now insert the context that Fairy's only two weaknesses are the worst attacking types in the game while Water/Poison are both weak to at least one of the best attacking types in the game. And Dark/Psychic only match up well against pretty mediocre types, while Fairy's positive matchups are generally REALLY valuable.

I put this up with Gen 1 Psychic, and I know there's no way the devs do not understand how busted Fairy is. Gen 1 and 2 both had a Psychic box art legendary. Gen 3 had one Dragon box art legendary while Gen 4 and 5 had two. Gen 6 and 8 had a Fairy box art legendary, while Gen 7 gets four all with a new version of weather. Gen 9's box art legendaries are two types that can hit Steel in a game with Terra Steel.

&amp;#x200B;

Also lets look at a Mythical's type in every single gen

Psychic/Psychic/Steel/Arceus/Steel/Fairy/Steel+Fairy/Steel

pokemon,Pok√©mon 25th Anniversary Discussion Part 23 - Pok√©mon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee,"Ah, the Let's Go games. The Yellow remakes that effectively function as FRLG remakes. I didn't care much for them when they released (mostly because I was too caught up in the hype cycle for Smash Ultimate), but recently I looked at them again and went ""hey, maybe I should play them"".

Status: Currently playing Let's Go Pikachu (currently at Silph Co.)

Thoughts: Honestly, I really don't think this game is as bad as everyone seems to make it out to be. Actually, quite the contrary, they're pretty solid. Let me start with the good: first of all, this game looks really nice. A lot of the graphics are just really solid and just make Kanto look great. I have a theory that Let's Go was going to release on the Switch regardless of how it did, while SwSh was made for the 3DS as a failsafe before the Switch. Feel free to say whatever about that, I suppose. But anyway, to be honest, my ideal graphical style for Pok√©mon would be a cross between Gen 6 and this. People say 3D didn't work for Pok√©mon, and I can see that with battles, but I can't deny the overworld and how these games make it feel. (Limited) character customization is nice too (I've been wearing the sailor outfit since Vermillion). The follow mechanics in this game are actually good, and the cutscenes and Pok√©mon interactivity are pretty good too, partially owed to a smaller set of Pok√©mon. The fact that Let's Go is a Yellow remake helps with it's exploration, since Kanto is a decent region. I made it all the way down to Fuschia City before I hit up Silph Co. in Saffron, but that leads me into the worse parts of the game. My two biggest gripes with this game are the gym requirements and the general GO-esque emphasis on catching (Though this was bound to happen because of the games aim at bringing in GO fans). Fuschia's gym requirement of catching 50 Pok√©mon just made me go ""meh, let's advance the story, then"". I don't mind the catching mechanics in this game, just the emphasis on it. Trace is also a very uninteresting rival. He just feels like a cookie-cutter friendly rival for the most part. Also the lack of abilities and cross-gen evolutions hurt the game a bit (especially since megas and regional forms are in the game). Overall, these things don't drag this game down a lot and it's been a really enjoyable experience. I can't wait to get down to Routes 19-21 for some water action. It's going to be great.

Edit: I forgot I wanted to mention the music. The orchestrated soundtrack sounds good for the most part (shining example being Lavender Town), though it makes a few songs a bit weaker (Pok√©mon Mansion lost a lot of its flavor in Let's Go). If I'm not mistaken, Shota Kageyama arranged most of the stuff for this game (coming back since he left GF after ORAS). He did pretty good on the soundtrack.

legostarwars,Crazy prices have ruined the fun of collecting minifigs,"To the point where i actually started to sell them. Some of them have reached a point where its simply just not worth it anymore, at least for me. I started collecting my clone wars figures maybe like 3 years ago. Back then they were still pretty unloved and the rarest, most saught after, most expensive ones cost around 15 euro's. I remember rarely paying more than 10 euro's for a figure. Everything was still fairly attainable and for ""fun money"". 

Nowadays thats a whole different story with the more sought after ones suddenly being 40 or 50 euro's. I mean i do like the figures but for 50 euro's i can buy a lot nicer sets or figures than just 1 special clone. And who knows, maybe in a couple of years everyone has forgotten the clone wars again and they will start being unloved again. So i've come to the point where i'm actually selling them. And i gotta find something else to start collecting.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,8 things that I think will be great in Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl remake,"if we are getting remakes of Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl there's are a couple of things that could happen and I have a list

**1:** Making Mt Coronet one gigantic Wild Area with several new areas in it 

(if we are forced to backtrack to that location over and over  again you may as well make it one gigantic interesting wild area)

**2:**.A Giratina episode

**3:** a 2nd episode focusing around the the Element plates,The Azure flute 

and the Pokemon god Arceus that can gigantamax and is lv 100

**4:** some of the routes rework so they don't slow down the player 

**5:** the players will now have a chance to catch Darkrai &amp; Shaymin

**6:** catching all the Pokemon from all the generations

**7:** have access to the Battle Frontier

**8:** have the ability to record your online battles from both in the remakes and in sword and shield and upload them to YouTube

And that's pretty much it for now

pokemon,I need help with my first UM team.,"Just had a blast playing through X for the first time with: Greninja, Charizard, Garchomp, Gardevoir, Aegislash, and Lucario. Greninja made for a really reliable sweeper against most trainers or random encounters while I think the standouts were Charizard and Gardevoir who both really helped me with the E4/Champion (though Garchomp's earthquake really helped too). 

I've done some research for UM, and so far, this is what I've come up with:

Incineroar (I really like fire starters, and cats)

Alolan Raichu (I've heard good things and it'd be nice to have a pure electric again on a team)

Starmie (Used one before in LG, and it was nice having a surf/psychic package)

Hawlucha (I'm not the biggest fan of fighting types (minus Lucario) but I've heard great things, and, need someone that can learn fly)

Garchomp (starting to feel like ""old reliable"", though I've heard you can't get the earthquake tm in this one 'till after the E4?)

________?


I still don't know who I should pick for my sixth. A few options I've considered, either for looks or stats are: Lilligant (used in Platinum and she kicked butt), Salazzle (love the look), Lucario again, Mudsdale (keep hearing it's amazing), Swampert (instead of Starmie), and Metagross.

I really like Tinkaton for that reason, actually. It's a fully-evolved Pok√©mon that, ultimately, I still think looks pretty cute. I just was curious if you guys felt the same way.

Its not even good for getting shinies anymore, as outbreak, sandwich and the massive spawn rate of pokemon on the overworld make it painfully easy to get shinies, even without the shiny charms.

So despite the quality of life brough to breeding, with picnic being able to breed anywhere and the massively reduced time to hatch pokemon, it seem its a completely pointless feature.

Is there anything it does better than other mechanics? Because when i look the numbers and do the math the only use i can find is to get the baby form of evolved pokemon if you traded it to complete the pokedex.",CallOfDuty,pos

I am just kinda casually learning on my pokemon and just kinda choosing what I think would be good to max stat wise on them.

I was wondering if there was a good source to use for suggestions on what is the ""Norm"" to max on certain pokemon? Or is it just kinda up to everyones feel? 

I tried to look through websites but did not find really what I wanted so figured Id ask for suggestions here to help me learn.

pokemon,Steel Dragonite OP?,"Steel Dragonite feels kind of over powered,  that pokemon has very well rounded stats in terms of power and is a very bulky dragon. Now he can negate his fairy ice counters by turning into Steel.
By being Steel he pretty much prevents being killed in one move negates all his usual counters.  
I've faced many Steel dragonites that terraform and stack a dragonite dance with iron head. If possible they stack 2 or 3 since you won't have a direct counter the moment he takes field. Iron head has a 30% chance to flinch the user. 

I once used a fire move on one but they didn't terraform so they got a free dragon dance stack and crushed me afterwards. I would hate if the game came down to a 50/50 on weather dragonite terraforms or not every time.",pokemon,neg

assassinscreed,Kephallonia Feels too Small for Odyssey's Prologue,"I'm currently playing through Assassin's Creed Odyssey and this is the second time I've done the prologue stuff in Kephallonia.  I fell off this game 2 years ago because the bloat got to me but what is striking me right now is how the small size of Kephallonia kinda undermines the story beats for me.  Everything so far is about how Kassandra wants to get off of this island that she's lived on for most of her life and how she wants more which implies that she knows this island extremely well.  And yet, she has no idea where Marco's vineyard is located despite it being about a two minute walk from her home.  And she just generally has to have people explain to her where things are located despite the fact that it feels (from the size of the play space) that she should already know this from having lived there.

The problem is that she can basically ride around the entire island in like 5 minutes.  Its absolutely tiny for how you traverse the world but the plotlines early on are all about Kassandra outgrowing her home.

I get that this is generally how ALL open world games handle their opening areas but I feel like Odyssey plays up the fact that this is really the only home Kassandra has ever known.  The way the quests are structured though feel very dissonant with the story they are trying to tell and I end up feeling like the immersion is broken.  Like the ""Small Odyssey"" sidequest takes place in these ruins on a small island near Kephallonia. Everything gets played up like Kassandra is discovering this area for the first time in her life...but this is all CLEARLY visible from the main city like a minute's boat ride away.  The illusion is completely shattered.

Does anyone else have this issue?  I'm surprised I do because of just how huge the game actually is.",thesims,neg

My question...does Sims 4 do a good job staying true to this? Wait for Sims 5? Re-download Sims 2 after a long time away?

ability: doesn't matter 

item: shell bell

strategy:  greninja will only reset sats once and will start with double team and poison spikes, will set up shield 4th turn and do two more double teams, alternate between amnesia and iron defense once your buffed start doing nasty plots once all buffed out use stored power. the shell bell will heal for massive hp gains. just keep in mind the due to the 3+ evasion on greninja some attacks will miss.

FIFA,Is div 3 the worst div?,"Now I should say that I got into div 3 before the latest patch and since the patch (the patch in my opinion made things 10 times worse. Game was just about ok before it) my form has been more up and down then a see-saw but there is just something about div 3 that is getting to me more then it should.

First off is the input delay that I'm currently dealing with. I know this is the same for pretty much everyone and I'm guessing with it being team of the year that it's worse as every man and his dog are on there trying to pack the worst looking team of the year in years (in terms of upgrades) but the input delay is horrendous even with the controller connected to the charger cable.

Second is the amount of skillers I'm facing. Now I'm not trying to sound like I'm complaining about this as its my own choice not to learn skills because I can't be bothered nor do I play enough to actually try to learn them but it's like every team has me going round in circles and then my team parting like moses and the red sea which again is my fault because I can't sit back and cover space bugger that.

Third is the need to seemingly celebrate every goal. Now that's fine when you score a free kick or a good free flowing move but when you score a tap in because the goalies are allergic to actually holding on to a ball I'm like really you're gonna celebrate that.

I'd also like to mention the squads that everyone seems to have but that's pointless because ea keep having to release icon and hero sbcs because they butchered the chemistry system to the point where the only way to actually have an interesting team is to just have a full icon/hero team

Yes I have just come off a 9-1 defeat as well but I either lose by 6 or more or go 3 up and they quit that's what I mean about my form. Only having to play it to get 90 matches (5 left thank god)

pokemon,My honest thoughts and ratings of each mainline game,"Let's get this started with this is my opinion, don't treat this as anything other than that. 


POKEMON RED/BLUE

I grew up on these games, my introduction to the series and the ones that made me fall in love with this series. I love the story, pokemon they introduced, the rival is THE rival and is honestly the standard others should meet going forward. However limitations of the time and the bugs that plague these games hold it back, but it's still a good game even today.

7/10


POKEMON YELLOW

My current go to copy of the gen 1 games. Not much more to say that hasn't been said about red and blue, I choose it because you can use all three starters as opposed to just one in red and blue.

7.5/10


POKEMON GOLD/SILVER/CRYSTAL

An interesting sequel with interesting pokemon. The dark and steel types are one of the best additions to pokemon to date and the rival is arguably even better than in the previous games. The story is excellent and area design feels like a massive improvement. Almost nothing bad to say about this game, though level scaling is odd at times.

9/10


POKEMON RUBY/SAPPHIRE/EMERALD

This one will trigger some people. I don't really like these games, I understand why people do but for me there's just something about them that I can't get past. The pokemon introduced are fantastic, the areas are great and the story is also pretty good, but it just doesn't make me want to play it. It would honestly be one of my last choices when it comes to the pokemon games. The rivals just don't feel all that special either, barely a shadow of the last two rivals. 

6/10


POKEMON FIRERED/LEAFGREEN

The best way to play the kanto games in my opinion. Here is everything that made red and blue great without all the bugs that make them red and blue. In my opinion, it's almost perfect besides just a couple things like the lack of a physical/special split. Other than that, my opinion is that this is a direct improvement on red and blue in every way.

9/10


POKEMON DIAMOND/PEARL/PLATINUM

This. This is in my opinion the pinnacle of the series. Or, platinum is at least. It's what I'll be using as reference for this one. The starters are so well balanced, so equally appealing that this is the first and only generation where I'm always happy with any of them. The pokemon introduced are some of the best in the series, I always struggle to choose pokemon for my team because there are so many good choices. Story is near perfect and the design of the game is just phenomenal. The only thing holding it back is the over reliance on HMs. 

9.5/10


POKEMON HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER

See my Gold/Silver/Crystal opinion. HG/SS is that, but better in every way. Near perfection with only a couple of things like HMs still holding it back.

9.5/10


POKEMON BLACK/WHITE

A great story with one excellent rival/antagonist and two middle of the road ones. I don't really like the pokemon selection here though, pair it with my least favourite group of starters so far and it just feels a bit underwhelming. I never feel satisfied with my team. The story is what carries these games for sure. Honestly it's hard to give a rating I think is fair. They at least mostly did away with HMs.

7.5/10


POKEMON BLACK/WHITE 2

Slight improvements lead me to like it more than the previous games but I still can't get behind the pokemon of the generation and it just holds it back for me. A good game but not the one for me.

7.5/10


POKEMON X/Y

One of my personal favourites. The move to 3D is great and I love almost every pokemon introduced in this generation. I always feel satisfied with my teams and I really like the story. Rivals are underwhelming and the difficulty really needs a bump, but mega evolution is one of the best things game freak ever introduced. I love Kalos as a region and all the areas around it. Truly feels alive. 

8.5/10


POKEMON OMEGA RUBY/ALPHA SAPPHIRE 

See my R/S/E review for my opinion, 3d improves the experience and mega evolution makes it even better, I at least enjoy these ones. Better than the originals. 

7/10


POKEMON SUN/MOON

The closest I've felt to playing the 2d games since 3d came out. Pokemon selection is middle of the road, I don't remember most of them. I like the regional variants and I like the story, but the ultras do it better.

7.5/10


POKEMON ULTRA SUN/ULTRA MOON

Better than their predecessors in every way. Starters leave a lot to be desired in my opinion and pokemon selection could be better, but the region is great and the difficulty has at least improved since X and Y. No more HMs either! Not a bad game by any means.

8.5/10


POKEMON SWORD/SHIELD

Really lacklustre. Routes are short and have virtually zero exploration. The rival never leaves you alone so it never feels like you're on your own adventure. Starters are mostly good, but could be better. Pokemon selection I actually really love, but the story is so underwhelming and predictable. It also makes almost no sense at all. DLC was better than the original game but the fact we have paid DLC instead of decent post game shows the motivation of the series from this point. The first foot in the grave for pokemon.

5/10


POKEMON BRILLIANT DIAMOND/SHINING PEARL

Rushed, filled with bugs, unfinished, broken. Gen 4 nostalgia is the only reason this gets a decent rating, along with the fact there's no HMs. Just play platinum instead, for your own sake.

4/10


POKEMON SCARLET/VIOLET

I was so excited for these games and left so underwhelmed once I played them. Performance is bad, but I'm willing to look past that. I do like the rivals, and the main(ish) story with mabosstiff is pretty good, but honestly I don't love any pokemon from this generation. I hope the DLC is better, because these have potential  but they just don't reach it. 

6.5/10

Let me know what you'd change on my list!",CallOfDuty,pos
pokemon,Well do you find playing Pokemon alone boring too?,"I had this idea üí° just now my first unofficial pokemon game was Brick bronze and the thing that captivated me was how tgere were other online players too while this is added in the new scarlet and voilet but not all can have the luxury of a friend that still finds or plays pokemon.

While this might seem like a lazy post I have little to no idea of programing but what i exel at is a little world building.

GTA,GTA 5 stuttering,"I played GTA 5 a lot before, but when I got a new PC, the game became unplayable. I've been trying all of the limiting the frame rate and all those other things in the NVIDIA Control Panel, but it doesn't work. My new PC is a good gaming PC that handles every other thing, but GTA 5 specifically runs bad. The graphics are so bad and the game keeps stuttering either when I'm walking, driving or in the menu.

FinalFantasy,Here is my mainline FF ranking nobody asked for,"I have seen a couple of these around this subreddit and I want to put it out there so other people can tell me if they agree or disagree with my take. All of these I have played to completion either this or the last year (not all 100%, but at least finished the mainline story), being the only ones that I haven't got into either because it wasn't my thing or because I lacked the hardware: XI, XII, XIII-2, Lightning returns, XIV, XV and VII:Remake.

1.- **FF X and X-2 (PS2)**: The music, the characters, the combat system, the world building... I love them all, but probably the thing that makes it stand out above all the rest is the aesthetics, being the most unique out of most games I have played. I am including X-2 in this even if by it's own would probably be way lower because I love how it expands the story of X, particularly how the fall of a major religion is the cause of a deep ideological crisis in a world that used to be center around it. It may be the ""First Final Fantasy Syndrome"" but it really is the one I like the most.

2.- **FF VI (SNES)**: Absolute classic. Everything about this game works perfectly and it's a shock that so long ago they managed to make such a cinematic experience for the SNES. The combat is snappy, the pixel art is really nice, the music is amazing... the only thing putting it behind FF X for me is that the last characters to be added to the party (wendigo, mogul, the mimic guy) don't have much of a personality and act more like extras than anything.

3.- **FF IX (Steam)**: It's just a really nice game from start to finish, with great characters (call me basic but damn I love Vivi). My only problem with it would be that I barely remember any music from it and how the final boss, though thematically in line with the story, comes out of nowhere just to eclipse an already a really good villain (who in term already did the same trick but much more effectively). I don't mean to say the music is bad at all, I remember enjoying it, I just can't pinpoint an specific track that I can remember off the top of my head like with every other game.

4.- **FF VII (PSOne)**: Probably the best first act out of any Final Fantasy ever. All the way up to disk 2 it is an amazing experience with great world building that def rivals the one in X. Reasons it is behind is that chocobo breeding is cryptic as hell, how underwhelming killing the final bosses was (the reward for killing Crimson Weapon is literaly the thing you needed to reach it in the first place, why) and how it took me by surprise how characters seem to be dropped out of the main picture once their arc is finished (even if the story isn't), it isn't terrible, but Barret, Cid, XIII seems to just become a dialogue box once they are done and Vincent and Yuffie barely have any story to begin with (Vicent being way worse in this aspect). I don't know, I can see where the love for it comes from, but maybe the expectatives the internet gave me made me enjoy it less.

5.- **FF V (GBA)**: Somewhat in the same level of FF VI. Everything about it works and the job system is very well implemented. The only thing keeping it behind the other games would be the fact that the story is quite more cliche, making it feel like a second take on FF III's one.

6.- FF I (GBA): It's simplicity at it's best. Really feels like playing through a fairy tale. The quality of life changes and the GBA secret dungeons elevate the experience quite a lot and it makes it a confort playthrough for me to do from time to time. The thing keeping it low is that it is really really simple to the point of basicly just being a ""mash A"" playthrough, particularly after you meet Bahamut.

7.- **FF IV (DS)**: The story of this game is bananas, man. Like &gt;!going to the moon to meet Gandalf after the tower in the middle of the map became a decepticon?!&lt; Really? that's cool. That being said, how so many characters just&gt;! ""sacrifice"" to later come back!&lt;lessened the impact of their big moment so much so many times that became a very annoying trope. It's alright though, would recommend.

8.- **FF XIII (Xbox 360)**: It's alright, I think it got too much undeserved hate in it's time just because it was the ""it's cool to hate-review"" era of the internet. This being said, I could barely follow what was happening because the game felt very awkward in the way it exposed the progress of the group from one point to another and the combat system wasn't my cup of tea, although it wasn't annoying. Really good music too, and beautiful aesthetics overall.

9.- **FF III (DS)**: A game with very interesting set pieces (&gt;!leaving the first continent is still in my top 3 FF moments!&lt;) that for me is being hold back by the job system not being too well implemented and the story itself not being that interesting in the first place.

\- From this point on I straight up can't say I liked the game enough to play it again -

10.- **FF II (GBA)**: I love the villain of this game and it had a very daring story for its time (like how many characters die and how it isn't afraid of showing you a villain that actualy is moving forward in it's plan despite your efforts). But the dungeon design is horrible, the trap rooms are an awful idea and the leveling system begs you from abuse it rather than use it. Recently another user of this subreddit showed that it can be completed without any grinding at all, but I can't say it was my case at all.

11.- **FF VIII (PSOne)**: I hate this game. The only thing I like about it is the cinematics which quite a lot are very cool (&gt;!the airship fight, the monsters on the moon reaching, the parade, floating through space, the time collapsing one...!&lt;), some music and Laguna (this one being double edge because it made me feel like there was a much more engaging story if he was the main character instead of Squall). The first disk isn't too bad, but once that is done it feels like the only characters in the game are Squall and Rinoa, Squall being the most insufferable tryhard edgelord in any Final Fantasy I have ever played. I literally can't remember anything the other characters do at all. The combat is so slow, the enemies scaling with you force you into using the junction system that is unintuitive and either a pain in the ass if you don't understand it or makes you completly overpowered if you do. Also I don't get why people like Triple Triad so much, it is a fun minigame for a couple of matches, but once you have a couple of strong cards it just becomes RPG Criss-Cross. I honestly don't understand how anyone would play this game for the first time now and enjoy it, let alone be their favourite FF game.

And that's it. I also started FF XII but never finished it because I found the story too based on exposition and didn't like neither the gambit nor the license system. But I can def see why people would enjoy it and the aesthetics and music are fantastic so it would probably be ranked 10.

Thanks for reading and please let me know if you agree or disagree. Kinda expecting people to call me out for disliking VIII so much, but I am not trying to fight your experience if you liked it, I respect that and honestly would love to know why you enjoyed it.

FIFA,anyone come up with answers as to why we have had similar complaints from people basically since release. Will try to explain,"I have been wondering this a lot and am really curious if anyone has the answer.
I will try and explain best I can.
So since the very start of the game we have seen post after post of complaints about this that and the other suddenly not working well. 
For examples: passing suddenly not working, shooting suddenly not the same, tactics were good two days ago and suddenly now they are not, players were fine a week ago and now they are stuck in the mud, dribbling was great two days ago and now it doesn‚Äôt work and so on and so on. The list is endless.
People seem to say that it has been like that for them for two or three days to a week. 
But the thing is we have seen these same posts since the game released and see them regularly ever since so how can all of them be right????
This would lead me to believe that the game has been spot on brilliant for a vast amount of people until said random person posts that it‚Äôs suddenly not. But how can that be every week since release????
How can all these people have had great gameplay up until they make their post of complaints. 
I hope I managed to explain what I‚Äôm asking here properly.

GTA,Unpopular opinion: Michael de Santa deserves to get killed.,"Everyone says that Deathwish is the best option because you get to keep all of the 3 characters but Michael kinda deserves to get killed, Michael planned with franklin to kill Trevor while Trevor didn‚Äôt know any about this stuff and Franklin wanted to keep peace between the two characters, Trevor and Michael Where best friends yet Michael still wanted to backstab him for no reason. Also after you kill Trevor that was Michael idea later when you meet him in the game The conversation goes like this:
M:What are you doing here?
F:Man you being real weird dude
M:Yeah well you did something really weird Trevor bro so excuse me
F: Man you did Trevor too
M: Yeah but it was your call you made that call don‚Äôt you forget that, man I‚Äôve done so much for you
F: But what the amount of shit I‚Äôve helped you with I thought we were in this shit together man fuck
M: Just look i need some time alright goodbye
F: yeah, peace.
Michael will leave and then you wont be able to hang out or play with Michael, Michael tries to defend himself and says that it was not his fault that Trevor died because Franklin ‚ÄúMade that call‚Äù which is true but Michael planned to kill Trevor.

Now when I am defending it goes like this: I'm having my selected player follow the opponent and waiting for the moment to tackle and usually I miss so he goes through on goal because all me OTHER defenders are just looking and let it happen

pokemon,Make a regional Eevee,"Up front, not on reddit too often, this might be something people talk about already.

So first off since they are limiting the pokedex to 400 in games now, i don't want them to just make more Eeveelutions because they already take up such a relatively large chunk of the pokedex. UNLESS they make a regional variant with 3 or more different newly typed (for eevee) evolutions and keep the original Eeveelutions out of the pokedex (even if you still can get them in game like Quagsire in Gen 9).
They could keep Eevee normal type if they wanted, then add less evolutions in its first appearance to keep it fresh.
Alot of people have obviously wanted more Eeveelutions for a while, but its honestly almost annoying sometimes remembering that in the days of well liked pokemon being cut, they have to leave room for 9 pokemon just for essentially 1 line. Also, I do like eevee and its evolutions, but it gets a bit exhausting sometimes knowing that all you need techinally at least 8 of the same thing.
Is this already something that gets talked about, or is it not something people would really be interested in seeing in favor of keeping what we have/just adding more to normal eevee?",FIFA,pos

[Team](https://preview.redd.it/xm8g0nzhjsda1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=af8332ca5f0c4a62c42ce9a49f39d6939e292d9c)

So the only skill moves I use are ball roll and fake shot stop. My timed finishing is switched off, and I also don't use second-man press. Not meant as a brag, just encouraging those who don't use these things that they're not essential to getting high ranks. I'm more of a dribbler who likes short and agile players, and my team is built around that.

**TIPS:**

1. Use players that work for you, not players that others use or players that are expensive on the market. IF Diaby is the best wide player I've used, and I've tried a number of more expensive ones. He is just very responsive on the ball for me, so I've kept him for this long. I also like my attacking CMs to be short and agile, hence why I still use Lemar.
2. Find your best camera settings. I finished 11-7 last week with different camera settings.
3. I played 3 games on Friday, 2 on Saturday, 10 on Sunday, and 5 on Monday. The games on Friday and Saturday were very delayed and I struggled even against opponents with rare gold squads who seemed like D4 level. If I had played all my games on Friday and Saturday, I'm not sure I would've reached even 14 wins.
4. Don't sprint too much. You usually get tackled when you're sprinting because the ball is not close to your feet and the defender sees that opening.

**CUSTOM TACTICS:**

Formation is 4321 with Diaby left, Gomez middle, Pulisic right, Zakaria CCM.

Balanced, 48, 60 | Balanced, Direct Passing, 60, 5, 2, 2.

If my opponent is through-balling a lot, I lower the defensive depth to 40.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

GK: Comes for crosses, Sweeper keeper

LB and RB: Stay back, Overlap

LCM and RCM: Get into the box for cross

CCM: Stay back

CFs: Get in behind

Not to mention how much easier it is to breed competitive pokemon if you compare it to previous generations.

The only thing that was frustrating was the hand-holding throughout the entire plot and the unevitable linearity of Alola when it comes to advancing through the game.

pokemon,I dislike fakemon.,"
As much as I like Pok√©mon art, there is one thing about the art community that I dislike, and those are the fakemon and the ‚Äúredesigns‚Äù.

First off, I know how much work goes into making fakemon or creating redesigns, and I don‚Äôt want work like that to be discredited, and I‚Äôm not saying ALL fakemon designs are bad, I‚Äôve seen a few good ones. However I do have some criticisms about modern fakemon and Pok√©mon redesigns.

Fakemon tend to be designed to look cool and not unique, and that‚Äôs one of the problems I have with Fakemon designs.

I simply find fakemon to be quite bland and devoid of any unique personality except ‚ÄúRawr I‚Äôm an edgy cool over the top monster‚Äù, many people say, ‚ÄúOh this fakemon looks so much better than the Pok√©mon in the games we have today‚Äù, and while that may be true, fakemon AREN‚ÄôT Pok√©mon. 

Pokemon are unique due to their balance in design, they aren‚Äôt made to look too cool or too cute, they are supposed to look like something that a child can bond with and most importantly they are supposed to be memorable. I can‚Äôt recall the many times I‚Äôve seen a thousand fakemon designs on Instagram that were just an over the top edgy dragon/monster thingy. 

A sub category of fakemon that I strongly dislike are the ones who redesign the Pok√©mon, and at times claim to have ‚Äúfix‚Äù a Pok√©mon‚Äôs design. 

Now I honestly think that the process of redesigning a character sounds like a fun thing to do, technically regional forms and the paradox forms can be considered ‚Äúredesigns‚Äù. However I dislike the way that most artists redesign Pok√©mon, and it‚Äôs the same thing with how they design Fakemon, over the top, edgy, and bland, only except they are putting these qualities on Pok√©mon already exist. The same goes for artists who do regional forms too, if you count regional forms as redesigns. 

To conclude, I respect the work that goes into making fakemon or redesigning Pokemon, but I simply find most designs are bland and devoid of creativity. 

Dare I say it but part of me gets annoyed seeing artists pumping out the cookie cutter formula of making a generic anime monster and labeling it as a Pok√©mon, regional/paradox form, or a redesign.",pokemon,neg

assassinscreed,Let's discuss about the map size/setting of AC Codename Red.,"How big you want the Codename's Red going to be? Since Origins/Odyssey/Valhalla covered most of Ancient Egypt/Greece and Medieval England respectively, I am hoping Codename Red to cover most of Japan including it's 4 major islands; Honshu, Kyushu, Hokkaido and Shikoku with some overseas territories like shores of China and small parts of Korean peninsula. Also I am hoping they will add huge cities like Edo, Osaka and Kyoto in much bigger scale and not like how they showed Memphis, Alexandria, Athens and London in recent AC games which is completely cutdown versions from the real-world counterparts. I am not asking to be completely 1:1 scale, at least bigger version of it like Paris and London from Unity and Syndicate respectively. It's better if we have huge countryside of recent AC games combined with dense and larger cities and towns from the older AC games for the perfect parkour and Japan could be the perfect setting to have best of the both worlds. Also hoping to see Mt Fuji in it's fully glory in the game.

And for anyone who thinks AC Red is not interesting since Ghost of Tsushima is already set in Japan or they got dozens of games set in Japan already. Let me clear you this;

1. GoT is not set in mainland of Japan, it's just set in a small island of Tsushima that lies between southernmost tip of Japan and Korean peninsula.
2. Most of the games that's set in Japan like Sekiro, Nioh 1/2, Persona, Yakuza etc we never really got to explore the full historical open world Japan like we usually see in AC games, are we? Sekiro and Nioh is set in fantasy Japan with heavy action elements and they're non-open worlds, while Yakuza and Persona set in a modern times with a smaller maps again surely they're not historical. Maybe there's vast majority of Japan-based games out there, but either they're small in map size or non-historical or maybe both or in completely different genre.

pokemon,I respect those who love competitive but I just don't get it,"I've been playing the games as long as I can remember. I'm not the best player, my mindset revolves around covering and exploiting as many weaknesses as I can, I'm not one for the competitive mindset. I don't really ""get"" competitive, it just seems like too much. You spend a ludicrous amount of your time (as the gens go by less and less so, fortunately but still a lot) min/maxing every single stat of all 6 Pokemon, and draw from a pool of like less than 30 Pokemon of over 1000 that are competitively viable. The base games are simple and straightforward because they are children's games. They weren't made for such heavy competition, just to have fun with friends. Evs and ivs were made to make the individual Pokemon more unique, but now they're used to fine-tune and perfect the Pokemon, with each species having to have a set required amount, that defeats the whole purpose of making them unique. It's like eugenics, breeding the perfect species and discarding the ""failures."" I think competition is interesting and it's nice that the games can provide so much extra entertainment but there's an elitest attitude I hear rumbling from time to time, ""post game is where the real game begins"" ""that Pokemon sucks because it isn't viable."" People ask if x Pokemon is good to use: ""yeah it can do this, this, and this, counter this, wall that, set up these-oh you mean in the games? Bro they're literally children's games use whatever."" I wish there was a Smogon but just for story players, I know it sounds ridiculous but I know I'm not the only one who can't make up their mind and don't have a competitive mindset. Theirs just this huge gap between story and competitive that serves to gatekeep in a way, most of my points aren't competitives fault, GF should know by now that a majority of their fanbase is older, I think a step up in difficulty (at least an option) would serve to bridge the gap and ease normal players into having to use these skills, instead of trying to make something out of nothing.
Anyways, I'm sorry for the novel, this is something I've felt for a while and I'm perfectly ok with being wrong and called out. I probably didn't properly express my thoughts. I'm happy to properly explain my points further in the comments below.

Tl;Dr: I'm a story player who is fascinated yet wary of competitive. I think there's a huge divide between these types of players and the games are the issue. I wanted to express my frustrations and opinions on comp after hearing critiques and not so positive  about story players and their mindsets. If the games stepped up in intensity and difficulty, that could serve to bridge the gap and allow story players to try using more skills instead of forcing the games to be more intense through player v player comp.",thesims,neg
assassinscreed,How do the Assassins not stand out?,"Have you heard of this phrase before? ""Hide in plain sight"" well of course you've had, it's one of the mottos for the assassin brotherhood, but how exactly do assassins hide in plain sight when you are wearing the most standout outfits examples include: almost every assassin existing except Altair and maybe Jacob and Bayek because Altair can be mistaken for a preacher,  Jacob is just wearing a coat, and Bayek looks like a wanderer or traveler, something not to pay full mind to. So as you know the assassins wear fancy robes that make them really stand out, imagine, you are a templar and you are just walking in the streets and then you turn around and you see a strange hooded man in a crowd or sitting on a bench and as a templar, it should be obvious that is an assassin but no you think nothing of it and then the next thing you know he stabs you in the back. I mean some assassins wear a belt with the Assassin's creed insignia or have it somewhere on their robes for god sake! and as a templar, you couldn't notice that? and it's not just the templars, it's their guards/soldiers too, how does a take a few seconds to realize that strange-robed man on the roof is your enemy? I know it's just gameplay but it doesn't really make a lot of sense that it takes a while for them to completely notice that the robed man who might be wearing the assassin insignia is actually an assassin and also how they can't see you on the bench or in a small group of people when they are wearing what is the equivalent to wearing a clown costume and thinking you won't attract attention, like what the hell were you thinking. Not all assassin robes look suspicious like the majority of assassin robes like Altair jet again who could just be mistaken for a preacher or monk whatever they are, and Arno and Jacob who just wear normal apparel with a hood on it which goes the same with desmond who is technically an assassin, Bayek also does a good job at not being so conspicuous like the other assassins because he appears as a simple looking man nothing the pay attention to except maybe the visible weapon and shield he has on him.",FIFA,pos

FinalFantasy,Thoughts on what will happen in FF7 Rebirth,"I assume that the majority of the plot points will remain the same, however since the Whispers are no more, maybe events and locations to visit could happen in a different order, of course with everything expanded to give more life and sidequests.

 I presume also that we'll get a reset of the inventory sans level (we'll probably have the party remain at level 50 and keep most of the abilities) because Yuffie will steal our things. 

And judging by the trailer, I assume at some point we'll have to deal with Crisis Core stuff related to Genesis (hence the white feather). 

Maybe we'll switch at some point on Zack perspective in the other timeline?

After S/R **and before D/P** we had a gen 1 remake. After D/P **and before Black and White** we had gen 2 remake. After XY we had a gen 3 remake. BUT, after USUM we didn't have a BDSP remake, but a gen 1 re-remake. We had to wait after SwSh for the BDSP remake (again, **gen1 remake before gen 4**). Following this line of remakes and re-remakes I see coherent that the next we'll have it's a G/S re-remake, following the Let's Go mechanics or even an actual remake before we get the Black and White remake, since pokemon games are annual and there's been only one year since last remake.

assassinscreed,Be weary when playing older Assassin's Creed games on pc. This is the second game I'll not be able to finish because of a glitch. First happened in AC Brotherhood and now with AC Revelations.,"This is the second time now that I won't be able to completely finish an old AC game because of glitches, bugs or crashes. Let me explain: 

In AC brotherhood right after finishing the last puzzle with Desmond you need to go back to the main platform where the other characters are standing. The camera switches to a top down view and you are expected to walk to the middle of the room where the Apple is located. Well the moment the games switches to the top down view all my inputs get disables (both keyboard, mouse and controller) meaning I cannot make it to the middle of the room. No big deal since it's basically the ending of the game. 

In AC Revelations I've made it to the part where you have to kill Shahkulu. I did the jump to assassinate him and right when the fight begins my game crashes and shuts down. Every time I relaunch the game right when I should get spawned in the game crashes again so it's an endless loop a.k.a. I can't continue with the story which I'm pretty bummed out about.

With both games I've validated the game files, deleted and reinstall, ... (basically all the troubleshooting things you can do) so yeah be weary when playing these games on pc.

I was hoping that people who have played the more recent installments could give me (spoiler free) recommendations?

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll play multiplayer or that zombies mode very much, so I‚Äôm only interested in the missions and story. Any advice would be much appreciated!",Tetris,pos

I tried taking out the 4 EPs I have, but still nothing. I've installed DirectX and VC++. The game isn't even giving me an error pop-up to respond to, starts to load, closes the launcher, and then nothing. Tried from both desktop and through the EA app.

Specs:

Processor	12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H   2.30 GHz

Installed RAM	16.0 GB (15.7 GB usable)

System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor

Pen and touch	Pen support

Graphics is Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060.

OS is Windows 11.

Call me crazy but I believe that Final Fantast 16 could win GOTY even over Tears of the Kingdom, not just because the game seems to nail masterfully every aspect, a rare feat in the genre but because there's and there'll be a certain favoritism from media outlets. General public is unarguably more hyped for Zelda but media outlets are all looking forward more for FF16 (saying that it shapes up to be one of the best FF ever, huge GOTY contender, etc..) but for TOTK, they praise the new mechanics but are still over it being too similar from BOTW. Feels like this year is shaping up to be another 2020 situation which was REALLY divisive with the general public massively voting for Ghost of Tsushima but media outlets preferred The Last of Us 2. On the other hand, I also see another 2022 situation: one of the reasons that God of War Ragnarok lost against Elden Ring is because as a sequel that didn't do enough to be different, it didn't give the same wow as GoW 2018, and TOTK is already giving the exact same impression.",pokemon,pos

thesims,The Sims 4/3/2 Sharing Capabilities,"Back in The Sims 2 days, you could use the Custom Content Browser and download content from the Exchange, especially MaxoidMonkey stuff (Maxis stuff) and other player-made creations; but the player-made creations there are quite limited. So, you usually have to go to the website directly and browse the Exchange for creations and then download the Sims2Pack file to your computer. If the person uses an expansion pack that you don't have, then you simply cannot install the sims2pack file. And if you download a custom neighborhood built with an expansion pack you don't have, then you can't play it at all. Theoretically, you could upload Houses to the Exchange with Sims/Families but this is problematic because it severs the relationships which can directly lead to game corruption. So, all inhabited houses in the Lots &amp; Houses bin are corrupted, excluding the Kat and Kim families (made by Maxis). 

The Sims 3 will actually allow you to play a Lot or Sim or a World, even if you don't have the owned expansion pack, stuff pack or Store Item. 

The Sims 4 not only has the above Sims 3 ability, but also you can go into the Gallery and see what item the Lot or Household uses. You can also filter out items in the Buy/Build catalogue and only use Base Game items, for example, and this is great for building a Base Game compatible lot that will actually show up properly in everyone's game.",CallOfDuty,pos

GTA,"I asked ChatGPT to give some help to Napoleon, but my boy can't catch a break!","&amp;#x200B;

With the power of cheat codes from GTA: San Andreas, Napoleon's invasion of Russia took a completely different turn. Instead of leading a massive army, Napoleon simply typed in the ""spawn tank"" cheat code and was instantly surrounded by an army of tanks.

As he approached Russia, he typed in the ""raise wanted level"" cheat code, causing Russian forces to come after him with full force. But with the ""never wanted"" cheat code, Napoleon was immune to their attacks and easily made his way into the heart of the country.

Once there, he typed in the ""health, armor, and money"" cheat code, granting him unlimited resources to take on the Russian army. He also used the ""fast motion"" cheat code to speed up time and quickly conquer Moscow.

But the Russian winter proved to be a formidable opponent, even with cheat codes. Napoleon tried to use the ""change weather"" cheat code to make it sunny and warm, but it had no effect. Eventually, he was forced to retreat and type in the ""teleport to safety"" cheat code to escape the wrath of the Russian winter.

In the end, Napoleon's invasion of Russia with the help of GTA: San Andreas cheat codes was a wild and unexpected ride, but it ultimately resulted in a hilarious and improbable defeat.",CallOfDuty,pos

The Sixth gym is Steel, which is super effective against Ice.

Each gym gives you something to take on the next gym with. If you face the gyms in normal order, the TMs (e.g. focus punch) should help with the next gym.

In the case of the former, it's the Family of Three form; the latter has its Three-Segment form.

This has made me think, ‚Äúcould this mechanic be retroactively applied to older Pok√©mon?‚Äù. The answer lies in Weezing's DPPt Pok√©dex entry: **‚ÄúIt grows by feeding on gases released by garbage. Though very rare, triplets have been found.‚Äù**

When it comes to rerolling mass outbreaks, the usual way to is to close the game, change the time to 23:59, open the game again and wait for it to turn to midnight. I've only ever seen people use this method, changing the time every reroll.

My current method is to change the time, open the game, let it roll over to midnight. Then, exit the game without saving. Change the time back to 23:59, and wait to it to roll over with the game closed. From now on, opening and closing the game will reroll outbreaks every time, without needing to change the time. (Only save when you found what you wanted)

If this has already been discovered, let me know and I'll remove the post, but I found this by myself and haven't seen any evidence of it online.",GTA,pos

pokemon,"Which Pok√©mon could use/receive an evolution, pre-evolution, variant evolution or regional evolution?","This is a personal follow-up to a comment I left on a topic about ""least used Pok√©mon"", as I stated how Pok√©mon without evolutions tend to be under-utilized due to the ""lack of incentive"". So I decided to ask you guys what Pok√©mon could use a new evolution stage.

For me:

* **Tauros / Miltank**: Tauros is always male and Miltank is always female, so a veal pre-evo that evolves according to its gender would make sense. Males could be brown and females could be pink.
* **Kangaskhan**: Kangaskhan is always female, but basic zoology taught us that there are male kangaroos XD Once again, a joey pre-evo (*being modeled after the baby*) that evolves according to genders could work. For the male variant, I could see a leaner version being Ground/Fighting, piggybacking on the idea of the ""boxing kangaroo"" trope.
* **Jynx**: This... may be controversial, but Magmar, Electabuzz and Mr. Mime got both pre-evos and evos. Kantonian Jynx could evolve into a valkyrie-esque Pok√©mon.
* **Lapras**: With all the talk about how the species returned from extinction, I'd like to get a pre-evo, to represent how they can breed normally :)
* **Sunflora**: It being Grass/Fire is a huge request, but if so, it should be a new evolution using a Fire Stone.
* **Unown / Sigilyph**: This one may be weird, but those two feel related in some way. Going from a letter to a crop animal looks like a logical evolution.

Those are just examples, what about yours ;) ?",FIFA,neg

1.agent 47(hitman). hed definitely have a zoroark, since it can disguise as another pokemon, and his whole thing is being stealthy with disguises. id also think hed have a normal decidueye, since decidueye is also meant to be stealthy

2.jotaro kujo(jojos). this ones a no brainer. im giving him machamp since its basically star platinum with an extra set of arms. 

3.kiryu kazuma(yakuza). hed definitely have shiny gyarados as its basically the same colour as his back tattoo. since he has 4 fighting styles in yakuza 0/kiwami, im also giving him machoke to represent the brawler style, snorlax for beast style, and anything that has double team for rush style since rush style is all about evading.

4.goro majima(yakuza). this one was way trickier than kiryu. i settled on honedge because his signature style(mad dog of shimano) uses a dagger, but if you have better options for majima please let me know.

5. rico rodriguez(just cause). i have two options heres. one would be giving him kingambit to represent how he often controls revolutionary armies in the just cause games, and also giving him 2 bisharp and 3 pawniard to further go with the whole army vibe. the other would be giving him nothing but voltorbs that only know self destruct, since he always blows stuff up in the games.

6. hank anderson(detroit become human), hed have mabostiff to represent his dog sumo. i feel like he could also have lucario to represent connor but im only doing this because i cant think of what pokemon connor could have.

pokemon,Pok√©mon could be also for adults,"Many in this fanbase think that Pok√©mon is for kids and it cannot tackle more mature themes, but to me it's false. I think Pok√©mon would fit well in a more mature context. Here's why:


- most of this fanbase is composed by late teens and adults. Writing stories that could be interesting to them costs nothing. Pok√©mon Adventures and even Pok√©mon's cousin The Legend of Zelda show this;


- trying to screen kids from the ugly things in the world just doesn't let them grow up and develop their mind properly, because they begin to think that the world is a perfect place where friendship and good always win. They should know that it's full of dangers and scary things since a very young age;


- Takeshi Shudo, the creator of the anime, and various scrapped plotlines like Kanto and Kalos's original ones show that Pok√©mon can get really good at stories and storytelling. Also, the idea that Pok√©mon could also be for adults comes from Shudo.

To show what I think Pok√©mon should be, I'm going to write a fanfiction that will prove my points above. Pok√©mon shouldn't completely lose what made it deep and interesting. Let me know what do you think.",CallOfDuty,pos

thesims,I built the first apartments I ever lived in in in my own as an adult,"When I was 18-19ish, I moved into these apartments that were actually a semi-converted, old roadside motel.  

Some guy had bought them and converted like three units into one big, nice apartment for himself, and he was basically the apartment manager, and then he rented out the rest as ""furnished apartments"", but they were basically motel rooms, lol.  I had needed to get out if the house and on my own, and this place was available and allowed you to pay the rent weekly, so it fit my needs at the time.  

The furniture in Sims 4 is much nicer, lol, and I don't remember it being so cluttered. I think the units were a bit bigger,and if course at that age I didn't have much stuff.  I might go through and redecorate and make it a bit more austere and realistic for folks living in those types of apartments. 

I wish I had space in this lot to out a double wall between each unit.  I think all the lights and Willow Creek are the same size? I put it in Willow Creek though cuz that's my favorite and I only have the base game. 

Basically, the three rooms on the left here are the apartments, and the larger two rooms in the back are the apartment manager's, with an office over on the right, if you can picture it.

I wish you could set up legitimate multi-family dwellings.  When I put this together, I thought I'd be able to lock the doors in such a way as to simulate apartment life, but I don't think I really can.  They're all just all over the place, lol.  And it irritates me that I can't put a computer on a counter for the office.  Still fun though.

FIFA,"EA , update prime icons.","Dear EA, you still have time to fix your mistakes and make prime icons usable.  
You know what I'm talking about, the fact that people prefer to use basic dembel√® instead of inzaghi, shevchenko, bergkamp.   
This is ridiculous, come on, really.  


How can you fix this?  
Simply upgrade and make these players as strong as they were.  
(I will take as an example players that I have seen play and that I can therefore talk about quite confidently)  


The first example, creating inzaghi's instinct in the game is impossible, but increasing his stats to make him ""usable"" can only be the right thing.  
I will not be here to describe the players to explain why inzaghi never forgave the goalkeeper or everything else, we all have youtube and the official data on the goals scored.

https://preview.redd.it/sotumogjz3481.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc0bb4a35df8200e921e549956b6ab49e89fd6a

The second is nesta, one of the fastest defenders of those times and one of the defenders with more class in the movements, come on EA wake up.

Then there is kaka which moves slower than fekir.   
EA YOUTUBE NOW.

This is the latest example, Shevchenko, made beautiful left foot goals and drove the defenders crazy.

I thought I had more time but I have to get back to work, these are players I saw playing in Milan and I used them as an example.  
I'm sure the various Laudrup, Henry, Bergkamp, Van Basten, Keane, Giggs etc. deserve this treatment too.  
It would help the game with variety in the teams and would give more importance to these icons that have now become useless. Yes, Shearer, you.  
With all the special cards coming out it is a must to update these icons!

I have to go (sorry for the mistakes in english)

Today, when I saw the new trailer and the vehicle forms for both legendary, I was hyped up by a 1000%. However, it's mostly Miraidon that hyped me the most. I'm a Kamen Rider fan and having a pokemon that transforms into a bike and actually rolls, damn that a lots of points toward violet for me.

But if we can set which pokemon we can mount, if we have both (**thank you trading**), I could go on an adventure as an Orange student, but on an awesome bike instead of an awesome lizard. In USUM, we could set which legendary to mount for Ultra Warp Ride between Solgaleo and Lunala, though that's a bit of a different case.",FIFA,pos
CallOfDuty,[COD] Do you prefer core or hardcore?,"Both modes do require different aspect of skills.

Core: Being more accurate with aiming and learning to save bullets as possible

Hardcore: Less health points, no HUD, being more quicker with aim, and no health regeneration (unless you use stimshot)

Overall, I like hardcore but I can play core

thesims,"Regarding the ""Include Custom Content"" checkbox in the Gallery","In game when browsing the Gallery, checking Include Custom Content obviously adds new items into the search of Lots, Rooms and Households. When you add an item to your own library, is the custom content downloaded to some EA directory (not your own mods folder) or does the custom content get stripped out of the file? It's hard to tell what custom content is actually included or not included. Sometimes you'll go into CAS and get a notice that CC was removed because the owner is no longer logged in or owns the content.

Its all a very confusing system in place and maybe it is long neglected or support stopped years ago for it from EA? Any insights into what actually happens when I check that box?",FIFA,neg

I was diagnosed with ADD so my mind would veer off during class A LOT and I would hum out loud and also do doodles of Gilagamesh haha. This was the early 90s so I don't think many people knew about the songs.

pokemon,My initial impression of BD/SP (2 hours in),"Like a lot of people here I‚Äôm a diehard Pok√©mon fan. I‚Äôve been playing my entire life and Gen 4 holds a very special place in my heart. I‚Äôve probably dumped the most hours into my old copy of Pearl than any other game I‚Äôve ever played. 

With that being said I truly feel that BD/SP is a very solid and thorough visual REMASTER of the classic. It does not feel like a complete remake like HG/SS did. This to me doesn‚Äôt feel like a bad thing. 

A lot of people including myself were worried about the forced exp share but I‚Äôm here to reassure you that it really is not that big of a deal like we all feared. While the rest of your team does get exp it‚Äôs about 1/4th of what the lead Pok√©mon gets. This essentially helps your whole team stay AROUND the same level but it doesn‚Äôt make you get over leveled for any one area. I still find myself having to think about what move to use next and the gym leaders, at-least the two I‚Äôve fought, still pose a bit of a challenge to the underprepared. 

The addition of Jirachi and Mew is very nice. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd feel about being handed two mythicals but after having to hack them into older games it‚Äôs nice to have them legit regardless of how you get them. They both can be obtained before the second gym. 

I don‚Äôt mind answering any questions you guys may have but keep in mind I‚Äôm not that far into it so I may not be super useful. My hope was just to reassure all of us fans that this at the least will meet your expectation of being a good remaster and a good Pok√©mon game.

Edit: this is not to say the game is perfect in any way. I went into this game with low expectations based off of what Pok√©mon has been putting out in the past few years. The game still has fame rate issues in the new cutscenes they added and the lack of voice acting or some kind of voice option is pretty jarring when the characters are being expressive. So in short, you still need to read walls of text. Also the game itself doesn‚Äôt look AMAZING. Definitely didn‚Äôt disappoint me as much as Sw/Sh but it‚Äôs not great compared to other switch titles. Overall it just satisfied me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad game at all. It just didn‚Äôt blow me away or let me down.",GTA,pos

thesims,I actually prefer the Sims 4 to the other Sims games,"I know in the Sims community, TS3 and TS2 are generally seen as the best games on top of the fact that TS4 gets A LOT of hate, but I actually love TS4 the best. However, I won't act like I'm not biased in anyway. I'm 22 and I didn't get TS3 until earlier this year, and I stopped playing TS2 when I was 10 as my best friend who owned the game moved away lol. But I've been playing TS4 since it was released, so now I think I'm just too used to the way TS4 functions and looks and the other Sims games just don't hit the spot for me.

I wish they did as I used to love TS2 and was feeling nostalgic last year so literally bought the game + all the expansion packs (they were like ¬£3 each on Amazon). I played it a few times and just got bored. Decided to give TS3 a try earlier this year and bought the game + a few expansion packs. I got into this one a lot better than TS2, but I still got bored after a week or so. Or rather, I wanted to play TS4 more.

The thing is, I bought TS3 BECAUSE I was getting bored of TS4. But playing TS3 only made me realise all the things I love about TS4. The graphics, build mode, CAS, the way the Sims look in general, even the custom content I like better. I also just prefer the way a lot of things function in the game, I feel like there's a lot more detail for certain things like the weather calendar, the cellphone options, the lot details, etc. 

I enjoyed a lot of stuff about TS3 as well, and I hope TS5 will be a combo of TS3 and TS4.",pokemon,pos

 The Exp all actually makes me feel less attached to my team I find that a lot of my team members end up getting ignored because they're already caught up with everyone else so I never really need to use them unless they're good against what I'm facing. Another games I'm either able to turn off the EXP all so that I can actually use a Pokemon for a few levels before swapping them out with someone else but now it just feels really unnecessary to do that.

I'm really curious if anyone else feels the same way about it as me and I do apologize if I didn't really explain this all that well",FIFA,neg

Barcelona won the 2006 Supercopa de Espa√±a 3-0, and not 4-0. Deco scored the 2nd and 3rd goals and not the 2nd and 4th like it says currently in his icon profile.

Edit: It's not wrong after all, since it was played on two legs. However it's still confusing because because the way they phrase it. It makes it seem like it was only in one game. So I was confused when I searched on youtube and was expecting to see the goal they mention in the bio (the acrobatic goal) to be in a 4-0 win and it wasn't.

GTA,"GTA V had a great story, far better than IV's story IMO."," GTA V had a great story, far better than IV's story IMO.  
 

the reason why GTA V's story felt unfocused, is because the whole game was like a TV series with multiple plots and chapters, the structure was sort of similar to red dead redemption 2's story, except here we do heists instead of setting up new camps every once in a while, because the game is nearly 20 hours long.¬† The story was basically like a¬†life¬†of three playable characters.¬† Which is the reason why it was praised by critics at that time,  
because no matter what you do in free roam it doesn't interfere with the main scripted narrative(since Free-roaming experience IS¬†the life that playable characters live,¬†and¬†why there are a lot of things to do post-campaign in comparison to GTA IV.¬†  
   
Hence, why the characters' motivation changed in between the chapters, and that's why the villains seemed to replace one another every once in a while, the missions of the game were episodes happening in the life of the three playable characters.  
   
GTA IV's story was a rags to riches story mixed with revenge storyline, which had been done multiple times, GTA V fixed this Cliche by adding 2 more perspectives from 2 different economic environments.  
   
Which made the story much more colorful and bigger¬†than any other previous GTA stories in my opinion.",legostarwars,pos

FIFA,POTM Messi WL review,"Obligatory first review post for my first 2 mil sbc... 

First to say I'm D1/G1 only, and by no means an elite player. Played 25 games with POTM Messi during this WL with 40g/25a with a 442 formation with Messi as the secondary striker to partner my FB Aguero

Chemistry Style: **Hawk**

**Pace (9/10)**

Won't feel as fast as Mbappe but still can enough to get past the last man if required. No real issues with the pace during the 25 games. (Especially against the 0 depth 532 users where there is no behind to get behind).

**Shooting (9.5/10)**

OH MY! THE FINESSE SHOTS! Managed to undeservedly drag a game till pens with an outside of the box, near post finesse. Finished most of the chances provided and gets into space easily. Also scored some freekicks even if my opponent put players on the line. The only drawback is it the shots doesn't rip the net in half like my TOTY Bruno.

**Dribbling (10/10)**

The skill moves, the regular dribbling, you cannot ask more from him. He manages to wriggle himself in the tightest of corners and with the 4\* skill moves, it is good enough to create the spaces for himself or his partner in crime. It is also significantly better than my untradeable gold messi which was sacrificed in this sbc.

**Passing (9.5/10)**

With the 25 assist I can't really ask for more. I just feel like sometimes his lofted passes are a bit underpowered, but it happens with all players anyway.

**Defending (NA)**

With 170 cm height? Don't ask.

**Physical (6/10)**

The stamina is fine until 70-80 mins depending on games even with my come back on defense instructions. That's where my Moments Dybala comes in, right? But for the physical, omg, a light breeze will make him fall over. I tested him in a squad battle game before the WL run and even silver player bodied him...

**TLDR:** is POTM Messi end game? Yes. Is he worth the 2 mil coins? Yes. Is he 10 times better than moments Dybala which cost 1/10th of the price or 4 times better than EOAE Rooney ? Definite NO. 

Consider this Messi as a luxury option.",FinalFantasy,pos

I am thinking about latest Scarlet/Violet but I heard they are bugged and there is even problem with saves being deleted :o

If you guessed right, its the Rowlet Line or more particularly Rowlet to Dartrix, are using their feathers as Throwing Knives up until Decidueye where he uses a Bow and Arrow.. Now I know certain pokemon in the grass line have used more prominent features as weapons, I.e. Sceptile with his Leaf Blades used like Tonfas/ dual-wielded bladed. Serperior using its tail like a Whip, Chesnaught using its Shell as an actual Shield or as farfetched using Torterra as a Battering Ram. Even Rillaboom has Drumsticks/ a War Drum which could very well be used as a form secondary weaponry.

From Generation 3 onwards the Grass line have had a possible relation to weapons, or I'm looking too far into it.

pokemon,ghost types are the fecking worst to deal with in universe,"if you live any where near ghost types and aren't a hex maniac, Miko/shrine maiden, aura user or got a natural connection to life force (N and Yellow) you are not going to have a good life. 

&amp;#x200B;

pretty much no every ghost type kills you or at best grievously wounds you by droping a fridge on your ass. litwick line eats your soul/life force and you don't even get to go the afterlife, at least if darkrai kills you get to go to the afterlife, Gengar just striaght up fist of the northern stars you when it feals like, sabylele can just kill you when feel board, dusclops and shednija suck your soul if you look at them in the wrong place etc. 

and counter measures to ghost type's

Own a strong pokemon

you have to live with that thing, strong dark types your going to be a social Praia, fairy type enjoy waking up at 2 o'clock to some stupid prank, normal and fighting types do nothing, water types get your floor mouldy, grass types have leach seed which is probably a crime to use since shoving seeds that drain the life out of your opponent is kinda messed up, steel types lost ghost resist and will probably fall through your floor, fire types are fire types, poison types will probably kill you, bug types sucks, normal and fighting can do jack shit against ghosts and everything else is something your not going to have.

your best bet is a regional bird but even then ghost types are just going to pop that thing 

Use a kitchen knife

pretty sure stabbing someone with a knife is considered a normal type attack and you ain't got no scrappy ability, at least with every. other Pok√©mon you can stab it. not even the safari zone guy could counter ghost types. 

become a heck maniac

look at them, their all nut jobs is this really a victory also you are forced to go buy clothes at hot topic which is a faith worse the death

shrine maidens/ mikos 

they're only a thing in kanto and johto, don't got a local tower then no cleanse tags for you

aura users and yellow 

you need to be born with that stuff and most of the time go find an aura user which theirs probably like 36 of in universe and even then you can't aura sphere that ghost type. 

if your like yellow do then you live the best life ever, no medical bills for you since she walked off her ribs getting smashed in like a minute

https://preview.redd.it/2e94ljaqu2ra1.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c15616ce6663f53096e7a0234f87eb3f039025b

Game Freak may have abandoned Battle Frontier, but small remnants of it have reappeared, like [Restricted Sparring](https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/restrictedsparring.shtml) in Isle of Armour, and a one-Pok√©mon battle mode in [Legends](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/update/). These have  similarities to features seen in the Battle Frontier.

[This shows Game Freak aren't totally done with battle challenges](https://preview.redd.it/o7a60iaru2ra1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34e5f0afbfba6c9a1c2820d9639369349c3827b6)

I think Blueberry Academy focusing on battling is very interesting. You can only access this after you've beaten the main game and part 1 of the DLC. You may be pretty high-levelled by then. You can only K.O every opponent for so long until it gets repetitive. Could this be the ideal time to bring something like Battle Frontier back?

https://preview.redd.it/2krpj720v2ra1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e5c195a151beaaeb91b6526d6cf2669ac160d0a8

I know **Game Freak** have been quite focused on Pok√©mon catching. Raids are basically the postgame for Sw/Sh and S/V minus the DLC, and we got two  games focused on Pok√©mon catching (Let's Go! and Legends). Pok√©mon BDSP didn't add anything to the game except Grand Underground, which was to help you catch more Pok√©mon. 

This is where my argument really begins. There's been a lot of focus on catching. And I think with Legends they were onto something brilliant. They are evolving the way you can catch Pok√©mon, and it's made the world *incredibly* immersive. 

https://preview.redd.it/tpmr66tv33ra1.png?width=471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a604793f9ffe9c164baf44cd4f0af5d4dac2ec4e

It's time the mainline games **separate** catching and battling.

Given you have good equipment, catching can be done without Pok√©mon battles. Of course your Pok√©ball might fail and you'll have to battle an angry Pok√©mon, but as you upgrade your equipment, even crafting your own balls with special boosts, you'll find it's enough. It becomes independent of battling, a skill in its own right.

Battling becomes something done just between trainers, which the Blueberry Academy could be the test ground for. 

Catching is something done between the equipment and the target - not beating up your opponent then sucking what's left of them into a Pok√©ball. (Battling *to* catch)

https://preview.redd.it/7t8l31w4z2ra1.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=65b42c7e80c86d753e97a67ff62d9fea07131deb

I'm not saying the current system is bad. It's brought us much joy over the years. Though to give catching and battling space to grow (in their domains) it could be time to separate.

See it this way: *Legends* was the test to expand catching. If you're good enough, you can do without needing to battle. 

*Blueberry Academy* is the test to expand battling. After the experimental Battle Frontier, Game Freak thought 'OK, we're going to step back', instead focusing on other things, while silently chipping away in the background on potential Battle Frontier replacements. (In whatever form)

As I mentioned, we've had sprinkles of Battle Frontier here and there, which is them testing the waters.

https://preview.redd.it/iwg1zycd13ra1.jpg?width=370&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4b2f70bda41207d3ea2e53969941fc55d17ebf1c

**Gen X** may mark the *future* of Pok√©mon. Legends and Scarlet/Violet were the 'toes in the water' of a bold new direction while Gen X is the whole foot.

You'll be able to master your Pok√©mon battling skills, or hone your skill at catching Pok√©mon. This means you'll have many more Pok√©mon in storage. 

There would be advancements in the storage system - it could auto-release Pok√©mon for you, and even filter more battle-ready Pok√©mon. You would configure it based on your goal. 

The battling aspect would of course include gyms and trainers, while leaning more into battle challenges/facilities as you're not spending so much time battling wild Pok√©mon.

*If catching and battling continue to be interdependent, you catch less Pok√©mon and battle less trainers.*",thesims,neg

FinalFantasy,The Big Unknown Casting a Shadow Over FFXVI,"In the last few months, I've gone from disinterested to genuinely excited about FFXVI. I hope it's great.

But should I play it at launch, or will I get the better or final canonical experience if I wait a few months?

Final Fantasy XV played today is a materially different experience from what it was at launch. The biggest changes were new content added to a handful of chapters to enrich the story, and an extra transportation mode for the Regalia, but also lots of general polish for enjoyability.

Maybe this is less of a concern for players who play through FF games multiple times in a short period, but as a player who might only play again years later if nostalgia strikes, I have to wonder if the launch experience will be the right experience for me.

Anyone else considering giving the game a month or two to see if they need to patch things up?",pokemon,pos

As I just stood there looking stupid trying to think of the third pronoun I felt embarrassed because I was failing to think of a simple word. Due to the nerves and me being embarrassed I let out a little laugh just a normal nervous laugh. My response together ended up being ‚ÄòUm he or him or uhhhh haha his,‚Äô"" Tran recounted.

The judge apparently responded, ""Okay just wanted to check to be safe. I go by they/them so don‚Äôt be a jerk about it.""

For the first netflix made pokemon show, i was really hoping they can tackle things pokemon company would never do by themselves while having the budget and market of the pokemon anime, like how arcane or sonic prime from their respective franchise.

The fact that we don't even have new game of sort, even some cheaply made free to play pokemon game for mobile makes this more disappointing, than if said new free to play mobile game came without a new mystery dungeon people would rather wish for.

pokemon,You shouldn't feel bad for beating Hop in Pokemon Sw/Sh,"You shouldn't feel bad for beating Hop, who is your rival in Pokemon Sword and Shield, and I'm going to tell you why : 

&amp;#x200B;

**1) You aren't responsible for his lack of self-confidence.** 

&amp;#x200B;

We know that Hop is a kid and he is very fascinated by his older brother, he sees him as a role model, as a goal to achieve, as an example he can follow. There is nothing wrong with that but Hop seems to be a little obsessive with that which is the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

What bugs me is that no one in Hop's family noticed that Hop was being a little too ""obsessive"" about his older brother, like his life only resolves around it. His goal is focused on beating Leon, when he is with you, he talks about Leon... Does this boy have another passions, another hobbies outside of copying his older brother? 

&amp;#x200B;

This boy definitely have self confidence problems as he is afraid to not live up to his brother's legend but you aren't responsible for these problems. I mean, you're just a kid with pokemons who wants to become the best Pokemon Trainer. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2) You have the right to become a Champion** 

&amp;#x200B;

Hop can't blame for wanting to become the Champion. He doesn't blame you and will never blame you in the game, because he understands that only the strongest Trainer gets to battle against Leon, so if he isn't the strongest, then he won't become the Champion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Leon and Hop asked you to be the rival but it's not because you're a ""rival"" that you can't win or that you're supposed to give up on your dream for someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, it's Hop's biggest dream, to become a Champion but... Why this detail would matter? I mean, it's a competition. It's not because Hop is so obsessed with his dream, that it's makes your dream less important or worthless. You have the right to become the Champion. You were endorsed, you got your badges, you beat him... You didn't play any dirty tricks on him. You played fair and he'll have to accept the result. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, it's not only Hop's dream but it's the dream of every challenger that participate in the tournament. Everyone wants to be at the top but only 1 person will manage to climb to the top. Hop knew the rules, like you, like everyone else. You don't have to feel bad for winning a tournament, you won fairly, you trained hard... You used your brain (compared to him who doesn't use effective moves). 

&amp;#x200B;

It's only logical that you win. You're the best, you win. Hop might be a kid but he'll have to learn it and deal with it because that's how life works... If Hop was expecting you to lose, then he is the wrong one and it's selfish. Humility is a great quality and Hop unfortunately, didn't display much humility which makes me wonder if the guy thought he was just going to win easily against you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Your pokemons are not toys, you can't just try to ""hold"" against Hop so he can knock out some of your pokemons.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Pokemons are friends, they are your companions. They love you, they have faith in you. You can't just betray them and get them knocked out because you feel bad for Hop and want to ease the battles so he doesn't feel like you've crushed him. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have to crush Hop, crush him!! Destroy him!! If he and his pokemons aren't strong enough, it's his problem. Don't forget that this guy wants to become the Champion. Do you seriously think that the others challengers will go easy on him ? No, they won't. And if he is aiming the top, then he'll have to be ready for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your pokemons have faith in you, they don't want to be knocked out. It's hurt to be knocked out. And it's hurt even more if their Trainer is holding them back for some guy who can't even use effective moves. So don't hold, and if you're too strong, then you will crush Hop but that's the game. That's how things work. 

&amp;#x200B;

By playing good, by crushing Hop, you are saving your own pokemons who need you. But letting your pokemons get knocked out on purpose against Hop is something evil. It's pokemon abuse. Besides, if Hop realizes that you're crushing him completely in a fight, he should try to start training seriously or learn about weaknesses and battle stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're not talking about a beginner Trainer but about a guy that watched all the battles of his older brother who is the Champion. If he can't even use a super effective move, it's not your fault... 

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Leon's attitude in this game towards Hop bugs me a little bit :** 

&amp;#x200B;

 Leon is partially responsible for this situation and doesn't do a single thing which is the worst thing, considering he is his big brother.

  
Let me explain :

  
During the game, I feel like Leon is favoring you over Hop. His interactions with you, the way he talk to you... I mean, sometimes I even felt like he was appreciating us more than his little brother which feel weird. He gives you an item in Motostoke for your starter but you don't even know if Hop receives one... When he see his brother crying in Hammerlocke, he doesn't react much...  
When his little brother lost against you, he didn't comfort him. He greeted you and was excited to battle you. Considering he have seen the match, he probably saw Hop's defeat reaction.

  
When you think about it, Leon doesn't seem to care a lot about Hop from the player's perspective. It's almost like he wants you to win against his little brother. Maybe because it's would be easier to battle vs you in the final match than Hop?

  
In that case, that's very selfish and immature from him to interact like that. As the older brother, he should support Hop and care about him. But his interactions give the feeling that he is happy that you're winning against Hop, because he won't have to battle against his little brother which is disturbing.

  
Maybe Leon knows that his brother is too obsessive about the whole thing but doesn't react and let things be. Instead of having a deep talk with Hop, he is avoiding the subject and is happy when you beat Hop.

  
This is probably why you feel bad. Because you feel like you're stealing the little brother place from Hop. And that is clearly a feeling that makes you feel bad for Hop. Because you clearly never intended to ""replace"" him. If Leon was cheering more for Hop, was comforting him, you would feel less bad as he would have some kind of support.

  
But since Hop has no support and you get some support from his older brother, it's put you in a weird position where you think you're favored and of course, you feel bad for Hop who is completely fan of his old brother. You feel bad that his big brother gets more interest in you than him which is a completely normal thing.

  
Leon is also asking you to take care of Hop for him, which is incredibly selfish. Because you are Hop's friend, not his therapist and when deep subjects need to be explored, Leon should act like a big brother and not give you the ""emotional stuff"". I feel like Leon doesn't really take his responsibilities in the story. He knows that something is wrong with his brother but he is ignoring it and then ask you to be a good friend and support his little brother.

  
**So don't feel bad for beating Hop and winning the tournament. Feel bad for him because no one from his family gives him support and have a deep talk with him which could solve the problem.**",assassinscreed,pos

pokemon,Are shiny Pokemon too common now? What if they introduced a second (rarer) shiny variant?,"I doubt this is a new or hot take, but aren't shiny Pokemon a bit too common in the newer games? They've doubled the chance to encounter a shiny from Gen 6 onward and have kept the rate the same since then, but in the new main line games since Let's Go the encounter rate for Pokemon in general has been harshly raised, hasn't it? In the same amount of time you will see a lot more Pokemon in SwSh or especially PLA and SV compared to e.g. Platinum. 

On top of that, every newer game comes with a whole bunch of methods to raise the shiny chance directly or indirectly (Shiny Charm, Mass Outbreaks, Sandwiches, Raids). 

While that allows more people to get a get a shiny more easily and allows collectors to complete their collections faster, it also devalues shiny Pokemon in general immensely. 

My solution would be to a) restore the old encounter chance for shiny Pokemon (1:8192) and b) introduce a second variant of shinies that takes the new high encounter rate for Pokemon in general into consideration. 

So, for example: assuming that you encounter twenty times as many Pokemon in SV than in older games in the same amount of time (an arbitrary number), lower the chance for ""rare"" shinies from 1:8192 to 1:163840 (or make them even rarer in comparison) and don't allow for any methods to lower that chance except maybe the shiny charm. 

That way, regular shinies are still relatively common and can be hunted methodically (and you could still use methods like Sandwiches in SV to hunt the rare variant as well), and every player has a decent chance to encounter one in their playthrough, but there's also a super rare variant that is harder to obtain and thus much more valuable.

While the different shiny sparkle effects do somewhat fulfill that role, I think a new shiny altogether would be much more exciting. Also, you could still have the different sparkle effects, making for an even rarer combination of shiny Pokemon. 

The way it currently works, actually seeing a shiny feels a lot less impactful in my opinion. In many cases, it's just ""...oh, there it is, a lot earlier than I expected"" or ""there it is! freaking finally!"" or ""oh my god, that's a shiny, the third one already this week"".

Whereas with this new variant it would be a lot more luck based. You'd still have the fun of shiny hunting plus the thrill of finding an even rarer variant.",FIFA,pos

GTA,I asked Bing to rewrite the story of GTA V with Niko Bellic in it. What do you think? I prompted some of the details like choosing option A or Roming coming to LS.,"The story of GTA V with Niko Bellic in it could go like this:

**Niko Bellic** is a Serbian immigrant who came to America to escape his violent past and start a new life. He lives in Liberty City, where he works as a taxi driver and does various jobs for mobsters. One day, he gets a call from his cousin Roman, who tells him he urgently needs help. Roman is kidnapped by gangsters who want to kill him for some money he owes.

Niko rushes to Roman's rescue and manages to eliminate the kidnappers. But as he escapes in his car, he is chased by the police and ends up in an underground tunnel. There, he stumbles upon an armored car carrying money from a recent robbery. Niko decides to seize the opportunity and steals the armored car, leaving Roman behind.

Niko manages to escape with the money and hides in an abandoned warehouse. There, he learns that the money belongs to a criminal group called The Professionals, led by a mysterious man named Agent 14. Niko realizes that he has walked into a dangerous situation and looks for a way out of town.

Meanwhile, **Michael De Santa** is a former bank robber living a quiet life in Los Santos under the protection of the federal witness program. He has a dysfunctional family and is bored with his daily routine. He longs to return to his former life full of adrenaline and adventure.

Michael learns about the Liberty City robbery and the money stolen by Niko Bellic. He contacts Lester Crest, a brilliant hacker and his old partner in crime. Lester informs Michael that Agent 14 is an undercover government agent using The Professionals as a cover for illegal operations.

Michael decides to find Niko Bellic and propose a plan: if Niko agrees to give Michael half the money, he will help Michael escape Liberty City and move to Los Santos with him.

Niko accepts Michael's offer and the two meet at the Liberty City airport. There, they are attacked by Agent 14's agents who want the stolen money back. Niko and Michael manage to fight them off and make it to Michael's private plane.

The two fly to Los Santos where they are met by **Franklin Clinton** and **Trevor Philips**, the other two protagonists of GTA V. Franklin is a young car thief looking to make a name for himself in the world of organised crime in Los Santos. Trevor is a former military pilot and colleague of Michael's who suffers from bipolar disorder and has violent and psychopathic tendencies.

Michael introduces Niko to the two as their new partner and tells them he has a big plan: to rob the biggest bank depository in Los Santos where Agent 14 keeps all the government's dirty money.

Niko agrees to participate in Michael's plan and becomes friends with Franklin and Trevor. The four carry out a series of preparatory missions for the final heist, such as stealing weapons, vehicles and equipment. They also face various enemies and rivals that get in their way, such as Armenian mobsters, the Mexican cartel, The Lost biker gang and even the FIB (the equivalent of the FBI).

Eventually, they make it to the bank depository where an army of Agent 14 agents awaits them. They make their way through enemy fire and enter the warehouse where they find a huge amount of cash. They load the money into their cars and prepare to flee.

But just then, Agent 14 appears and reveals that he has been manipulating them all along. He tells them that he orchestrated the Liberty City heist to lure Niko Bellic into the trap. He accuses Niko of being responsible for the death of an undercover agent working for him in Eastern Europe.

Agent 14 recognizes Niko as his old rival from the Balkan War. He calls Niko the ""Balkan Devil"" and tells him he has sworn revenge on him for everything he has done to him. He tells the other three that Niko is a bloody murderer who has killed hundreds of innocent people.

Michael, Franklin and Trevor are shocked by Agent 14's revelations and don't know what to believe. They look at Niko who denies nothing Agent 14 says. Niko tells them that it is true that he has done many bad things in the past but that he wanted to change.

Niko apologizes to the three for dragging them into a dangerous situation and says he doesn't want to involve them any further. He tells them that he will fight Agent 14 alone and that they need to leave with the money.

Here the game offers three final options:

**A) Help Niko kill Agent 14 and get away with the money.**

B) Let Niko die and get away with the money.

C) Betray Niko and hand him over to Agent 14 for a reward.

Each option has different consequences for the endgame and the relationship between the characters.

If you choose option A, Michael, Franklin and Trevor decide to help Niko kill Agent 14 and escape with the money. They realize that Niko is a true friend and doesn't deserve to die for his past mistakes.

They fight off Agent 14's agents and make it to the exit of the warehouse. There, a helicopter piloted by Lester is waiting for them and evacuates them. They escape their pursuers and hide in a safe place.

There they share the money and express their gratitude to each other. Niko thanks the three for saving his life and tells them they are the best friends he has ever had. Michael invites Niko to move into his house and meet his family. Franklin invites Niko to teach him some car driving tricks. Trevor invites Niko to show him how to make a pipe bomb.

Niko accepts the invitations of the three and decides to stay in Los Santos with them. He hopes he can forget his past and live a peaceful and happy life.

This is the happy ending of GTA V with Niko Bellic in it. üòä

Niko will get along well with Michael's family. Amanda will welcome Niko with open arms and treat him like a family member. Jimmy will admire Niko for his courage and skills and consider him a mentor. Tracey will find Niko attractive and flirt with him discreetly.

Niko will be loyal to Michael and his family and offer moral and physical support when they need it. He will enjoy having a second chance at life and being part of a family that respects and loves him.

Yes, Roman is likely to move to Los Santos with Niko. He will sell his business in Liberty City and buy a luxury condo in Vinewood. He will also bring his wife Mallorie and their soon-to-be-born child.

Roman will call Niko often and invite him to various activities such as bowling, golf and tennis. He will tell Niko about his life in Los Santos and his plans for the future.

Niko's mother may also come to Los Santos to visit her son and grandson. She will write Niko touching letters and tell him how proud she is of him. She will ask Niko to be careful of him and stop doing dangerous things.

Niko will feel happy to see his family again after so long and show them that he has changed for the better.",pokemon,pos

pokemon,"Theory on Paradox Pokemon, Terapagos and the Tera Phenomenon.","So I have a bit of a theory, a game theory one might call it, on how paradox pokemon, the new Terapagos pokemon and the Tera phenomenon are connected. 

So as we know Paradox pokemon are odd forms of pokemon we know that don't quite make sense, like the new Walking Wake, which is a dino version of Suicune, despite the fact Suicune is a revived pokemon from about 100 years or so ago, so having the past form being a raptor doesn't make much sense, i.e. the paradox, the fact it should not exist and is imaginary or something.

Now how does the Tera phenomenon and the Tera pokemon Terapagos come into this. We have to look at what the Tera phenomenon does, it gives a pokemon a typing it most likely doesn't normally have, a fairy type Skuntank for example, this change of type could be seen as a paradox, something that doesn't make sense. Terapagos is most likely the source of the Tera crystals, like how Eternatus was the source of Dynamax, with the crystalline look to its shell and the markings of different types on its back and the fact it will most likely have a gimmick relating to changing types or something.

So my theory is that Terapagos somehow links to a person or pokemons mind and creates stuff based on that, perhaps it powered the 'time machine' in Area Zero creating creatures the professor wanted to see/ believed were real. It also explains how the Walking Wake and Iron Leaves still exist after the machine is gone, because it only focused Terapagos's power to make the imagination real.",pokemon,pos

pokemon,What kind of ultimate solo Tera-raid team do you have?,"I tested several ways and found this to be the best one for me:

1.) Iron Hands (Brave)[Booster Energy]
Ability: Quark Drive

Moves: Drain Punch, Belly Drum, Close Combat, Earthquake

2.) Miraidon (Modest)[Magnet]
Ability: Hadron Engine

Moves: Electro Drift, Charge, Parabolic Charge (No fourth move, but maybe Draco Meteor soon?)

3.) Gholdengo (Modest)[Life Orb]
Ability: Good As Gold

Moves: Make It Rain, Nasty Plot, Shadow Ball, Power Gem

4.) Azumarill (Adamant) [Sitrus Berry]
Ability: Huge Power

Moves: Play Rough, Ice Spinner, Liquidation, Belly Drum

All level 100, properly EV-trained and max IV's. Combined, they have super-effective moves on all types. 

When Pokemon Home becomes available to SV, I imagine Ursaluna to be also very useful, as it is the only ground type with access to Belly Drum, not to mention also having Guts. I'm pretty stoked for it!

pokemon,Are Scarlet/Violet worth getting?,"Hello Everyone,

Pokemon has been my favorite video game franchise for my entire life and I have invested more hours into the series than any other. After hearing that this may seem like an odd question but are Scarlet/Violet worth getting?

&amp;#x200B;

I say this because I wasn't too big of a fan of Sword/Shield and Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. When I played through each of them I said the exact same thing by the time I finished: ""It's a good game, but for a Pokemon game I expect more."" I really don't want to have that feeling again. I thought BDSP were laughably easy and I think I thought the same thing about Sword/Shield. Not to mention the amount of dialogue in these games drove me crazy. When I played through them it feel as if I had to force myself to play through and I don't want to feel that way. I love Pokemon so much but I just wasn't impressed with the past couple main series games (I loved Legends Arceus btw) so are Scarlet/Violet similar to them or did they improve on these issues.",FIFA,pos
FIFA,"Usually I don't mind conceding cut back goals, but it is so irritating that the GK don't react properly","As said, I don't mind conceding cut back goals because I believe you cannot stop your opponents to reach those specific areas, you are more likely to concede a goal. But one of the way to get out of this is to effectively force your opponents to the line and have your GK to block the passing lane while the controlled defender to block other cut back pass. But no EA just forget to program any animation for GK to defend this kind of passes. 

After all, I found that you are literally required to ditch your football concepts to be good at this game:

1. Pass the ball even though your opponents block your passing lane - high passing stat (or when you have momentum haha) will override this
2. Tackle and slide from behind - I don't care how high is the tackle / sliding stat, it should be a foul by default since it is a bad decision (both football sense and gaming sense), but this is not always applied when playing FIFA
3. Over the top lob pass even though your opponent cover the space - I played some opponents just brainlessly spam lob passes until one time Haaland / Ginola / Mbappe just magically scratch their legs and through on goals
4. Constant pressure - don't want to talk too much about it. The stamina thing did not address it entirely. The problem is that the players are hardly impacted when they don't have stamina after doing those NBA full court press. Just watched the world cup, players got cramp when they are tired.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Tera Raid Bugs: Why your Bosses are healing and how to avoid it,"Hello Azumarill users! You guys and those who played with are you probably the only ones who have noticed this little issue in your runs. Considering that every Youtube video is recommending Azumarill for the level 7 raid I figured I should probably make a post with my findings to save everyone‚Äôs sanity on release day.

I‚Äôve seen quite a few people blaming Huge Power for the issue, while it is technically part of the issue the actual problem child is Play Rough. Play Rough damage will bug out and not accurately show the boost from abilities/items that exist outside of the typical mid battle stat changes (Huge Power, Life Orb, Choice Band, etc.). It will massively overstate the damage you actually doing before the game corrects it.

I was able to replicate the bug on multiple Pok√©mon with Play Rough only; since Azumarill was my primary test subject I can safely say a majority of their movelist does not have the same issue, so you can still safely run Huge Power, just not with Play Rough. I have also heard that Tinkaton‚Äôs Gigaton Hammer has a similar issue with Life orb; I haven‚Äôt tested myself but if true that could mean there are other moves that don‚Äôt interact properly with the aforementioned items/abilities.

So onto the ‚ÄúWhy does this happen‚Äù of the bug for those who care. Obviously this is speculation on my part since I haven‚Äôt been graced with a glimpse at the spaghetti code, but I feel this is mostly correct. So what happens is that there are 2 different Health values for the boss: The visual portion for the player and the invisible numbers for the game.

For whatever reason play rough is sending numbers that are way off to the visual aspect. So when the game activates one of it‚Äôs health checks, which seem to be at shield creation and at death, it sees that the visual aspect does not match the math and reigns it back in. This is what causes it to ‚Äúheal.‚Äù It‚Äôs actually removing the extra damage you thought you did because of an off item/ability interaction, but is still giving you the debuffs for hitting certain damage thresholds.

TL;DR: Play Rough does not Play Nice with ATK boosting items and abilities.

Edit: Updated post with accurate information, I actually found after more testing that the damage ‚Äúhealed‚Äù is the correct number, play rough actually displays almost double the damage of what you actually do until the game corrects it. You can test this on Azumarill with Aqua Tail, another STAB 90 base move.

However the game will still use the fake damage to cause the boss to shield and cleanse statuses early. This leads to you skipping stages before you are ready for it and this will constantly mislead your team for where they are actually at in the fight. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a placebo effect from not having an accurate health gauge, but it also seems to make the shields stronger and larger.",CallOfDuty,pos

I couldn't make her take a pregnancy test and there was no baby bump on her stomach.

I aged the baby up but for some reason the kid has no dad. I was worried because I didn't know if the baby belonged to her current boyfriend or her ex but I guess I don't need to worry now since the baby is dadless?? I really want to make the boyfriend the baby daddy but I can't change the genealogy and I'm super confused how the baby really has no dad at all.

Also really sad when I took the boyfriend to see his 'kid', they where completely strangers despite the boyfriend looking after the baby for a bit.

((also mention) that her ex is blonde and has white skin aswell as the mum whereas her current boyfriend has darker skin and dark hair, the baby had cooler skin so I'm guessing it's not the ex judging it by that)

FinalFantasy,"Final Fantasy X was the first game I finished by myself, when I was 22 years old","I've never been great at games, and I always underestimated myself.

As a kid I'd hand my controller to my brother during boss fights because I never could get the logic. Triple A games seemed like a daunting task I was just not able to do. I'd copy his save files to be able to see the world, as I couldn't unlock it by myself for the life of me. Dying in a game made me feel horrible and I couldn't get myself to keep trying. I was a girl and gaming was for boys, so obviously I was just not made for it.

That didn't stop me from watching other people play games though. I find the medium to be perfect for long term story telling, and if done right, one of the best ways to envelop myself into a world.

Two years ago, my partner told me about JRPG's and that battling wasn't like an FPS or a 3D platformer. He sat by my side with a manual - which I always believed was cheating but when FFX came out, it was normal and expected you'd use a manual. I pushed away all these mental barriers I'd made for myself, I wasn't ""bad at gaming"", I could do it. The final boss comes around and I have my first ""aha!"" moment during it, and kill the boss straight after. That was the best feeling ever.

Thank you Final Fantasy for showing me that single player gaming is possible for me, I just hadn't found the genre that worked for me. I don't think I'll be able to play a game like the Witcher or God of War, but I will make it my quest in life to play as many FF games as possible. Who knows, maybe the newer ones can help me find confidence in another battle style.

Since then, I've finished Link's awakening, Mario Odyssey and Luigi's Mansion by myself. I know these are not that difficult to beat, but it made me proud of myself. That's all that matters.

We bought FF VII on the switch last month and I'm in love, currently 25 hours in.

Whenever I feel shitty, thinking of Tidus laughing like a robot cheers me up. Cloud's (or Cloudy, as I called him in my playthrough) story of finding himself currently has such a tight grip on my heart. Please don't spoil it.

What other Final Fantasy games should I play, if I want a gutpunch story like VII? My partner really likes VIII as well, I think that one is next.

Exit to the menu and resume when stuttering

Delete all notifications in the notifications wall

Run the game in fullscreen

Disable vertical sync

Avoid alt-tab

Disable all online features

Disable all mods

FIFA,FC Ghana - 20 Games in Division 1,"So after being inspired by u/iward24 and u/hadtocrackthat on their Nigeria + Finland weekend league adventures, i decided to give it a go with Ghana. Having already completed WL this week, i thought why not try 20 games in Division 1.

If you're hoping for a success story, i've got some bad news... haha

[Customary kit, badge and ball combo.](https://preview.redd.it/6kszln5d1jy91.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fffc028ad61a649848c0e88ef463ca2eaae9a71)

[Formation and Squad](https://preview.redd.it/iqxuz4y62jy91.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd2f0d8c49a4e123f088790295aa32f2ea3fb55)

I'll start with Formation - 4231. I dabbled with 442 but felt exposed at the back too often and wanted another midfielder in there. I did go 442 - ultra attacking late in games when trailing as a hail mary. Tactics changed throughout but primarily 'press on heavy touch' 45 Width, 65 Depth and in attack - Slow build up and possession - 60 width. Again, player instructions changed through out but Inaki was set to get in behind.

&amp;#x200B;

[Statpad 1 \(Game disconected before kick-off once hence the 21 games played on some players\)](https://preview.redd.it/8klwuhdl8jy91.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37048385e0aad1833a06d15a70bd51ddc806e509)

[Statpad 2](https://preview.redd.it/kfx9e28p8jy91.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1090d27e33de1d8ddb28c9bb4549e5926b9f470a)

I wont go into too much detail on every player but as you can see from above, big shout out to Inaki Williams with his 17 goals and 5 Assists.

Apart from him we struggled all round. Gyasi, whilst being quite quick down the wing, was having a hard time of it. More often than not, bundled off the ball and with only Lamptey behind him for company, struggled to create. 7 assists over 20 games, considering the team, i'll take it.

Did i sell my soul to complete Essien? You bet. Was he worth it? Probably not but we do it for the content. I decided to go balls deep in this 20 game fuck fest so i commited to him. 

Lamptey, despite being smaller than the seven dwarfes, won way too many headers. Couldnt pass down the wing for shit but what a lad.

Aidoo, the CB of dreams. Outpaced Haaland and Mbappe on several occasions, could slide tackle a player into next week, won headers, hit the bar on many occasions from corners. Not very agile but i'll let him off.

Big shout out to Acheampong, you'll find out why later...

&amp;#x200B;

[The man, the myth, the... legend?](https://preview.redd.it/iz4zvrnl4jy91.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c3a9b5964a512d3a91d1bd1f084dfb3114eafa)

Now to this man... Richard Ofori. The highest rated Ghanaian GK on the game. The ultimate definition of ""sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit."" Spent the first 10 games learning how to dive, once he picked that up (and dropped everything else) he often had to complete numerous drug tests because he was everywhere. Conceded easy chances, saved things top bins.. Fallen in love with him anyway, what a guy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember i said this wasn't a fairy tale... see below.**

[Yes that's right... 19](https://preview.redd.it/7l7l4vnv6jy91.jpg?width=764&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f30d742d70d1362f757d705092cc986f886a3bb)

**0-1-19.**

Yes.

Acheampong with his only goal to secure a vital 2-2 draw away from home. Did i celebrate like England had just won the world cup, yes i did, am i proud of it, yes i bloody am!

**So to conclude..**

Losing 19 games out of 20 hurts, of course it does. However that one draw made this whole thing worth it. I conceded a shit load of goals with the majority being in the last 20 minutes as my players were dying from exhaustion from the 'press on heavy touch tactic' (I tried drop back but got slaughtered) Subs had very little impact on the game but that's okay.

Did some people try and take the piss from the start, yes but i think i gave some people a really good game and made them take it seriously. I had some terrible penalty decisions go against me several times and the amount of people who spammed trivella shots at poor Ofori was laughable. But i took that as a sign of respect.

I'm an average player so i always knew it would be hard but we gave it a good go. I've fallen in love with this squad and i will keep these guys for when i get bored of the Meta.

I honestly can't recommend this challenge enough, i actually enjoyed playing a game of Fifa for the first time in years.

Hope you enjoyed it. Now off to find another Country...",legostarwars,pos

assassinscreed,How are Mythology and the modern day story handled in Origins/Odyssey?,"I'm a big fan of RPGs looking to get Origins and/or Odyssey.

I generally like settings which try to be historically accurate and I also like settings that have more fantasy and mythological aspects, which seems to be what Origins/Odyssey fall under. But I've read that Origins/Odyssey treat their mythology aspects as ""not real"", like the main character saying they're just hallucinations or telling you it's just a simulation. Is that really the case? And how often does that happen - just during specific sequences or every time mythology gets involved? 

I like to get immersed in video game settings and this seems like something that would pull me out of that immersion.

I was also never a fan of the animus/modern day story when I tried earlier AC games like AC2. From what I've heard this has been reduced in the new AC games, is that true?

I don't mean to offend anyone who likes these kind of things and I don't think it's objectively bad or anything - it just doesn't align with my tastes. So I thought this might be the best place to ask, before I buy them and end up disappointed.

**TL;DR: I want to be immersed in the mythological aspects of the games and not have the main character see them as not real. Would I still like Origins/Odyssey?**",thesims,neg

That equates to trading a turn for the enemy to have an 83.3% chance of missing a turn and damaging themselves. 

If the damage they do to themselves is more than the amount of damage you would do to them in 16.6% of a turn then mathematically it should be worth it, as the trade off is favorable.

pokemon,I used ChatGPT top make a Thank You Ash Lyrics,"Before you go firing off, I need to make a few quick points.

\#1. I suck at making lyrics WITHOUT help, yes I suffer from a pretty bad Creative Block. 

\#2. Yes, I did ask ChatGPT to make lyrics in a specific way. 

\#3. I did do some editing to these lyrics a little bit just to ensure it was like a more standard lyrical layout. 

\#4. Like many I grew up on Pokemon: Indigo League, and While I have a distinctive, personal hatred for where they went from Sun &amp; Moon onwards, these lyrics do not berate any arc of Pokemon. 

\#5. Before you ask, my favourite games were the r/S/E games. 

With all those clarified, time to get to the main part of this post. 

As Ash‚Äôs adventures come to a close, I saw fit to fiddle with ChatGPT and to generate what I felt was some appropriate lyrics that pretty much act as a ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to Ash. 

Here is the lyrics: 

Verse 1: 

Started out in Pallet Town, 

Dreams that lifted him off the ground, 

With Pikachu by his side, 

A journey to fill him with pride, 

Friends he met along the way, 

And battles that he fought each day, 

Becoming a Pok√©mon Master, 

Achievements he'll never disband. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-Chorus: 

Your passion and dedication, 

Showed us the power of motivation, 

To never give up on our dreams, 

And to always aim for the extremes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chorus: 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you, 

For making our childhoods true, 

Your journey was our guide, 

And your story will never subside, 

From the start to the end, 

You showed us how to be a friend, 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you, 

For all that you continue to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Post-Chorus: 

Thank you, Ash Ketchum, 

For making us feel like we belong, 

Your story will always live on, 

And in our hearts, you'll never be gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Verse 2: 

Challenges that tested his will, 

Villains that aimed to fulfill, 

The world of Pok√©mon was vast, 

But he never lost sight of his task, 

From Kanto to Johto, Hoenn, 

Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, 

A journey that will never end, 

His story we'll always follow. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-Chorus: 

Your passion and dedication, 

Showed us the power of motivation, 

To never give up on our dreams, 

And to always aim for the extremes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chorus: 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you, 

For making our childhoods true, 

Your journey was our guide, 

And your story will never subside, 

From the start to the end, 

You showed us how to be a friend, 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you, 

For all that you continue to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Post-Chorus: 

Thank you, Ash Ketchum, 

For making us feel like we belong, 

Your story will always live on, 

And in our hearts, you'll never be gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Verse 3: 

A trainer with a heart of gold, 

Kindness that never grew old, 

Teaching lessons through each win, 

And losing with grace from within, 

The love he had for every creature, 

Inspired fans to be better features, 

Ash Ketchum, our hero, 

A legend that will never zero. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-Chorus: 

Your passion and dedication, 

Showed us the power of motivation, 

To never give up on our dreams, 

And to always aim for the extremes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chorus: 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you, 

For making our childhoods true, 

Your journey was our guide, 

And your story will never subside, 

From the start to the end, 

You showed us how to be a friend, 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you, 

For all that you continue to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Post-Chorus: 

Thank you, Ash Ketchum, 

For making us feel like we belong, 

Your story will always live on, 

And in our hearts, you'll never be gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bridge: 

You taught us to never give in, 

To keep pushing forward and begin, 

Your journey is a reminder, 

That with hard work, we'll always be a fighter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-Chorus: 

Your passion and dedication, 

Showed us the power of motivation, 

To never give up on our dreams, 

And to always aim for the extremes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chorus: 

Ash Ketchum, we thank you,

Usually by the time a new Pokemon game launches I know a couple of Pokemon I'm going to use, if not a whole team that I may or may not stick to throughout the adventure. But never have I encountered the problem that I'm facing currently: where I love so many of the announced Pokemon and so many of my old favorites are coming back that even if teams were doubled in size I wouldn't be able to fit a satisfactory number of them on there. This isn't an actual complaint, mind you, I'm praising the game for putting me in this position. It's nice to know that in addition to some of my favorite Pokemon like Houndoom, Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Mimikyu, Breloom, Eelektross, Wooper, and Ampharos, I also have a slew of great new designs like Greavard, Fidough, Smolive, Farigiraf, Lechonk, Bellibolt and Grafaiaia, to choose from. It's just the best problem the have, yknow? Like ""Oh no, I'm so spoiled for choice! How ever will I choose?!""

Edit: What I‚Äôve gotten from these comments is that no connection is canon simply for the fact that it suggests a multiverse.

CallOfDuty,[COD] A prayer for the future of the Call of Duty Franchise (knock-outs allowed),"
So as most by now know (and are more than well aware of) the new modern warfare world is rich with details. Not only immersion alone, but indeed too is featured freakin AWESOME animation, neat detail, incredible realism, weapon-headed tactics, and sick as shit graphics. I think to Clean House, The Embassy, WetWork, and more (up to and including the Amsterdarn level as well). 

So with this deeply incredible engine, with its interesting movement to a new future for the Call to Duty vidya. With rumors of usage of the same engine by Treyarch, along with anticipation of FUTURE Infinity Ward entries, I would come to God with a prayer, and to Activision with a request. 

And that would be to finally and at least differentiate between deaths/lethal kills, and knock-outs/non-lethal unconsciousness. 

Many game makers are doing it these days! We‚Äôve seen it in splinter cell, RDR2, in metal gear solid, and hitman too! It‚Äôs in GTAIV, and many, many more. 

The point that I‚Äôm making is simply is this: if I punch a civilian non-combatant, and they say mission failure? A bit disappointing fun fine I‚Äôll accept it, but just don‚Äôt call it a ‚Äúcivillian casualty‚Äù in the failure sequence, and quit treatin‚Äô it like a kill when it ain‚Äôt. 

There are knockouts and then there are kills. So quit not differentiating them.",FIFA,pos

FIFA,Quick review on some top tier players from a decent player,"Just wanted to say, I'm not that good with the game. Currently Elite 500 SR, 14-16 wins in WL. I've bought some FP here and there and got lucky with some packs early on, so i was able to try some top players in the game. I dont skill that much, only a few that i use often are ball roll, ball roll scoop, elastico, fake shot and heel to heel.

**Attackers:**

**94 R9 - 9.5** pulled him from icon pack back in November, over 600 games, and 700 goals. He's not perfect by any means, feels a bit clunky at times, and stamina and work rates are not the best. but still my favorite player cause he's R9.

**92 POTM Mbappe - 9.0** i've used Mbappe every year, but this year he seems more broken than before, some skills moves come off really nice and is nearly impossible to stop, comparing POTM to gold, there isnt much different.

**90 Jairzinho - 8.5** His SBC was around 1 mil, and at that price, it's a steal. This guy feels glitchy like Mbappe and his WF feels like 5 star, every shot is like a cannon ball.

**92 Cruff - 8.5** I was a huge fan of Cruyff last year, used his 89 version after TOTS, however this year his shot power really disappoints, still a very good dribbler and passer. but his shooting and physical are not that great.

**91 Butra - 8.0** Always a fan of Butra, love his prime in FIFA 20. This year i feel like defenders could body strikers easily, they could tackle from behind and push your attacker to the ground and no foul whatsoever. Butra is weak, otherwise his shooting, pace and dribble are all great, plus the 4\* skills on this card, makes it very good.

**88 Smolerak - 7.5** he feels clunky, WF feels like a 3 star, and he has 3 star skills, not a bad card by any means, but definitely not top tier

&amp;#x200B;

**Midfielders:**

**95 Bellingham - 9.5** I was a huge fan of his FS and TOTS last year, so i gave TOTY card a try. God damn he is near perfect, he could sprint through your entire defense that pace and strength and no one could touch him. He's got perfect work rates as b2b and amazing stats everywhere, definitely 1 of my favorite midfielders of all time. The only con is he's hard to link, i had to buy a WC Lucio that's massively overpriced to link him

**90 Gullit - 9.5** it's difficult to put a rating on Gullit. His cons are, a bit clunky, W/R not the best as b2b. and that's it. everything else is amazing, his advantage over Jude is the huge body, his presence in the midfield is like having an extra player,

**94 Zidane - 9.0** I was not a huge fan of Zizou last year, he felt really clunky and there wasnt really a position that suits him. However, this year Zizou feels much smoother on the ball and is a near perfect B2b. His pace is amazing, shooting is R9 level and he's super strong. only con is stamina and WR, but i can't complain.

**88 Vieira - 8.5** after comparing the stats between mid and prime, i decided to get mid Vieira. He did not disappoint. There are 2 types of CDMs, Vieira and everyone else. His long legs would wrap around attacker and dispossess them like they are not even there. Pace, strength, aggression all near perfect, and perfect WR as DM. Can't go wrong with big Patrick

**92 Xabi Alonson - 8.0** This was a huge surprise, i did not expect him to be anywhere near top level. But EA gave him huge boosts to all stats, and he feels extremely good at DM role. jockeying is great with him, and he's quite fast, passing is absolutely amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Defenders:**

**96 VVD - 10** the only player with 10/10 on my list. He's a perfect defender, auto defending machine. He easily bodies everyone and pushing attackers to the floor like nothing.

**90 Lucio - 9.5** the best defender before TOTY, his strength and defending abilities is next to none. Only con is pace at current state, he could be outpaced by some attackers. I had his base card for a long time, and WC card seems a bit better at defending in general.

**91 Ramos - 9.5** Pace isnt an issue for Ramos, his 98 acceleration with shadow makes him 1 of the quickest CBs in the game. his defending ability is at the same level as Lucio and VVD. If i had to name a con, it would be his strength, he does not body attackers off the ball easily like VVD. 

**88 Capdevilla - 9.0** This is the best LB i've used in game, i have not tried TOTY Theo, so i cant comment on him. but Cap is near perfect as stay back LB, his strong and quick, defending ability is top tier.

**88 Cafu - 8.5** baby cafu is great, nothing wrong with him, he's got better dribbling than most RBs, but a bit too short.

**90 TAA - 8.5** Cafu is a better stay back RB, but if you like sending full backs forward, Trent is your guy. his dribbling is great and passing is amazing. Only con is his strength, not strong as Walker.

&amp;#x200B;

**GKs:**

they are all the same, except Campos LOL. My favorite ones are 91 Cech and 90 Courtois.

&amp;#x200B;

I've only listed the players i've used recently, due to the massive jump in power curve from TOTY, it's hard to give ratings to players i've tried before. Let me know what you think!

What I did was on Christmas Day and the day after, I cloned some Shinys of either legendaries/mythicals or generally popular Pok√©mon and Wonder Traded them throughout the day. I like to think I made some kid's Christmas gift even more awesome, if even for a few minutes.

pokemon,Recovering my son's collection,"My son has been collecting Pok√©mon cards since he was five. He is nine now. He had aot of great cards, many gifted from former collectors.

This year at school, the kids started trading on the school ground. He begged me to bring his binder. 

About a month later, I was going through his cards and all of the ""special"" cards are, no surprise, fake. Basically the older kids are grifting the younger ones out of their legit cards for shiny fakes. 

With YouTube and Reddit, I taught my son how to identify fakes and he agreed to stop trading any of his newly acquired legit cards. 

But he is devastated that he lost all his great cards and has to start all over again. 

For Christmas, I want to get his collection back in shape. What boxes or boosters should I be looking at? I was also looking at singles online but so many of them are so clearly fake!

pokemon,An Idea for Pokemon,"I've been playing Voilet and enjoying it, but I'm seeing all the posts and concerns for the lack of scaled leveling. All the talk had me thinking. 

Who has played Shadows of Mordor? That game had a unique feature that I dont understand why more games do not take from. It was a nemesis system. It had different orcs that could grow with you and become leaders. And any time an orc beat you, he promoted. It is a neat idea if you have never tried it check it out.

Anyways, I think this would work GREAT for a pokemon game. Either a main title or a legends game could us this. If a trainer beats you, they promote. Maybe to gym leader or maybe to one of the trainers inside the gym. The gyms and trainers around you would always change. It would make the worlds feel so much more real and dynamic. Feels weird that you and your rival are pretty much the only two trying to really become a pokemon master in a whole world of pokemon.",pokemon,pos

Sure enough, the Ditto transformed into my Magicarp and was rendered absolutely useless with the only move it could use being Splash. This allowed my teammates to Belly Drum and use Close Combat to one shot the Magicarp while it could do nothing but Splash while my teammates set up. Easiest and quickest 5 star raid I have ever done.

pokemon,"For fans of primal theory, I have a theory about a certain similarity between Meowscarada and a saber-toothed tiger.","# 

&amp;#x200B;

To begin with, if you are a hater of this theory, just pass by before you minus this post. And it is not necessary to write words that ""You still exist"" and others.

Yes, we exist because and theory has the right to life.

Especially when there is nothing wrong with this theory.

I just happened to notice recently that the sharp end of the Meowscarada mask, lowered down, look like the fangs of a saber-toothed tiger.

Also, this Pokemon has a relatively short tail. They could have made him a long tall, but they made it short.

Which also makes for me a certain resemblance to a saber-toothed tiger.

assassinscreed,Original Assassins Creed combat,"Hello,

***Background***

I  bought Assassins Creed when it first came out in 2007, played a little,  got bored and then annoyed at a bug where I clipped through a wall, got  stuck in a building and quit the game.

After  that I didn't touch another AC game until Origins, which I absolutely  loved (one of my favorite games of all time), then I played Odyssey  which I though was 'OK', then tried Valhalla, which I thought didn't  feel very assassin like (even though my experience with AC was limited,  the world just felt flat) so I quit after a few hours of play.

***Question***

I  have now started to play the older AC games while waiting for Mirage (I  currently have AC, The Ezio Collection and AC:3 remastered),  and I  have a questions about combat in the first AC.

Is  the general approach to just hold RT and counter? Or maybe attack and  wait until someone is attacking you to then quickly press RT + counter? I  also cannot seem to find a way to stop people from breaking my block,  and the 'Step' function, I cannot for the life of me work this out,  regardless of the direction I press, I just step into the person I am  fighting.

Currently I have  completed 4 zones in total, 1 zone in each city then a 2nd zone in one  of the cities, so I have been testing for a while, but I just cannot for  the life of me figure out the best way to approach combat.

**TLDR:**  What is the preferred way to approach combat in AC:1? Hold RT and  counter for the whole fight, or a more active fighting style just using  RT when being attacked.

Thanks,",FIFA,pos

assassinscreed,Which Assassins Creed game suffered the most from being overhyped?,"Personally, I'd say that the one that suffered the most from being too hyped up before launch was Unity. I remember the early trailers and articles coming out saying that Unity was going to be the ultimate Assassin's Creed game with the best story and the biggest world, people were saying it was going to be the best AC game since II...And as we all know, it's launch was nothing short of a disaster as the game was literally unfinished. Full of fucked up graphical glitches, textural bugs, crashing, gameplay errors, noclipping into secret worlds etc. And even after all those glitches were fixed, people's impressions of Unity were already pretty dashed. Sure, AC:U has it's fans and people do say that all in all, it was a decent game, but the overhyping did it no favors and the disasterous launch turned it into a running joke and an example of games being released rushed and broken.   


Because of Unity's controversy, once Syndicate came out, no one really gave a shit about AC anymore until Origins came out which was a serious step in the right direction before AC went too deep into the RPG genre, but thats for another thread.",assassinscreed,pos

pokemon,Who can help me balance Pokemon types?,"Pokemon will never be a perfectly balanced game, and type identity is more important than perfect balance. But right now, the identity of some types is that they just suck. Hard. And some are just so much objctively better than others that it gets in the way of type identity. So I tried to balance things and question some balance decisions Pokemon made and add flavour where possible. Though I will admit this is a work in progress and I am very open to critique and advice.

When I say that one type beats another, I mean that it deals super effective damage to that type and resists its attacks.

Poison beats Fighting and Dragon because mighty warriors and massive beasts can be poisoned to death. So can a lot of things really but Poison needed a buff.

Psychic beats Fairy and Steel because Fairy tricks don't work on mind-readers and Psychics bend metal spoons.

Fire beats Ghost types.

Electric beats Dragon and Ghost and Steel. Electricity harms machines and metal things a great deal, Dragon deserves another weakness, and in mythology Ghosts and other dark creatures lose to things associated with holy divinity like fire and lightning. And silver but Steel does not deserve to be super effective against Ghost, that's just crazy talk.

Dragon only resists Fire. Really, it had no excuse to resist Electric and Fire and Water and Grass while dealing neutral damage against everything except Steel. Fairy and Steel were overtuned to keep the Dragons down. Ice deserves to resist Dragon.

Bug beats Fairy and Psychic. Yes, Bug resists Psychic now if it didn't already.

Ghost beats Psychic because fear breaks a psychic's concentration and if Psychic beat Ghost, Psychics would be too good and Ghosts would suck too hard. Ghost is immune to Poison.

Ice resists Water and Dragon. Ice is immune to Ice. 

Grass beats Ice and Electric.

Dragon loses stats in Hail/Snow and is buffed in the sun like Fire and Grass. Ghosts are immune to weather damage.

Psychic deals super effective damage against the Normal type. Maybe Ghost and Fairy do too. Normal is a lame type that deserves to be bad for refusing to engage with the type chart properly.

Rock loses to Flying and Ice and Water and Fighting and Grass. These types resist Rock and deal super effective damage against Rock. Flying is immune to rock. Rock beats Electric and Fire and Bug and Poison and Steel. Ground is removed and what was Ground is now Rock. Rock is immune to Electric and Poison.

Well, there you have it. I did my best but I am open to hearing new perspectives. I did a bit of nerfing overly strong types and buffing overly weak types, but my main goal was to add more type identity.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Future Proofing your 3ds!,"Hey all, (on mobile so sorry for formatting) with the close of the 3DS shop in March of 2023 I figured most fellow ‚ÄúFuture Proof-ers‚Äù would like to know how to get Poke Transporter* since I could not find any conclusive guides myself.

For those who might not know, on the 3DS there is an app (Poke Transporter) that allows you to move pokemon from BWB2W2 into Pokemon Bank. But this app is only available after you purchase a $5 Pokemon Bank pass and is not searchable in the store.

So this app is the ONLY way for you to get a pokemon from Gens 1-5 into Pokemon Bank and eventually Pokemon Home‚Ä¶.and for those fellow avid players who want to keep their bestest friendos I have your solution.

READ ALL THIS FIRST 


You will need: $5, your 3DS, a phone/computer.


1. Find your 3DS/2DS.

2. Go to your My Nintendo page on a phone or laptop. And go to settings.

3. Merge your 3DS and Switch Nintendo Acoounts (make sure to go into the wallet and combine the wallets).

4. (On your 3DS or online) Download Pokemon Bank and open application. Proceed to purchase pass page but DO NOT select Yes yet.

5. Go onto a phone or laptop and buy a $5 eShop gift card online (must be for 3DS eshop, I used bald man forest website).

6. Redeem gift card on your My Nintendo page and immediately proceed with purchasing $5 pass on your 3DS after amount is loaded onto your account.

7. Proceed to Pokemon Bank main menu, scroll down to ‚ÄúDownload Poke Transporter‚Äù and select.

8. Download app.

9. Now you can rest easy for a bit and the stress about getting all your cool pokemon into Pokemon Home in time :)

It only happen if the human and their partner pokemon trust each other and have a strong bond. When it gets dark, there is a cult that goes by W.E.G. means world-end genocide. The goal is to kill people that don't Z gene. Believes those who have are the superior being, as how they merge.

Introducing the first Legendary Pok√©mon! ...and my longest post of all time.

[Fanart by Noeleart](https://preview.redd.it/rq04pf4xzdba1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ed78a2e0808af896fd01d5ee8f7a5925b22fb22e)

**144: Articuno**

This probably won't surprise anyone who has been following this series, but Articuno is my favorite of the three Legendary Birds. I love bird Pok√©mon, I love the color blue, and I love Flying type and Ice types. But even separated from the aspects that make me biased to Articuno compared to Zapdos and Moltres, I actually genuinely think it's the most solid design of the trio and the one that's able to be taken the most seriously.

In general though, what's more surprising is that in spite of loving bird Pok√©mon, I'm not a huge fan of the legendary birds altogether. I think the problem is that like most Sublegendary Groups, there isn't really a lot of lore or relevance to them. They're hidden, you catch them in the late game, and you're done with it. Later Sublegendary Groups get relevant flavor text, but very few really serve in the narrative in any purpose, except Alola's Guardians and the Lake Trio.

What also doesn't help about this group is that none of the designs look particularly ""legendary"" or elevated over other Pok√©mon, in fact they're... kind of simple. They look less intimidating than many regular birds, since they generally are just colored elemental birds without any clearly divine properties.

If Articuno was a regional bird, with two pre-evolutions, I honestly could see it being an A+ Pok√©mon for me, on my main team. It's a pretty, somewhat badass blue bird, with pretty good wings and a long elegant tail. It's a bit too much body not enough wing for me, but it's still super cool and panders to a lot of my biases. Unfortunately, it's held back for getting buried under an ever growing mountain of Legendaries that are never utilized. I still love it though, but all Pok√©mon with the ""I love it BUT"" designation go to the **A- Tier.** Still very very high though!

[Fanart by Salanchu](https://preview.redd.it/z1ic8x0yzdba1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=af64f6d3905cf7b5fe084100dd52d5c81d7ce27d)

**144\*: Galarian Articuno**

This time... purple wins over blue for me. Unprecedented, I know, but between my two favorite colors, this version of Articuno takes the cake. But Toad! The Galarian forms of the Legendary Birds don't make any sense! Legendary Pok√©mon are individuals, not species with divergent evolution! Well I don't care, this Pok√©mon design kicks so much ass anyway.

Galarian Articuno shares it's typing with my favorite Pok√©mon of all time, and while I think Hisuian Braviary is cooler overall, Galarian Articuno is slick, elegant and badass, solidly improving Articuno's design in every way while preserving it's darker colors and thematic traits. The black belly, mask, larger wings pair perfectly with the tail and make this Pok√©mon one of the coolest legendaries period.

The segment to get it in the Crown Tundra was more interesting anyway, and while the logic behind the Galarian Legendary Birds may be weak, the separate species just exist and get to do more. I will, however, take the lack of lore justifying it's existence into account, but it's still a very high **A Tier** Pok√©mon, higher than the original, and that's going to be a trend here.

Cause yeah. All the birds will be higher than the originals. Hope you're okay with that.

[Fanart by Noeleart, again!](https://preview.redd.it/tiek1m0zzdba1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e6f25256db18bc9e117beb8d385dd803613ebb2b)

**145: Zapdos**

Hey, remember when I said that Jolteon representing electricity by being spiky was weird and made him my least favorite of the original three Eeveelutions? Yeah, I'm still not a fan of Zapdos much. You can call it bias against lightning or anything but I don't think the wildly spiky ""feathers"" work as a part of it's design. In general, I don't feel spiky and yellow is a good way to represent lightning at all, and a lot of Electric types suffer for it initially.

Zapdos is also a huge contender for not looking legendary enough. The thing that particularly gets me is just how flat it looks, without any detail of feathers or texture or anything. It's just one plain, solid, yellow spiky block. It looks incredibly average, not like the legendary thunderbird it's supposed to be. It's just not appealing to look at for me, and it's design only got more and more awkward with the transition to 3D artstyles when the thing appears in motion and the spikes stay static.

In the end though, I don't really have extreme negative feelings towards Zapdos. It's just a bird that exists, and happens to be legendary - it feels really average and forgettable, outside of Pok√©mon Unite where it's a pain as a swing factor, who's job is to get beat up in every battle. Not exactly the most legendary feeling. I think this is below average for Pok√©mon's usual legendary fare, but pretty average as designs go, so I'm marking it as **C Tier** in my eyes.

[Fanart by Siplick](https://preview.redd.it/0mvrkd200eba1.jpg?width=463&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a9a14d6f4192f4b12210c93c5c382197652d5e2)

**145\*: Galarian Zapdos**

Man. Talk about a complete glow up. Out of all the Galarian Legendary Birds, all of which I think were incredible upgrades, I think Galarian Zapdos had the single BIGGEST raw upgrade out of all of them. It's also far and away the most creative idea they had. Taking what was originally a flying bird and turning it into a grounded, fighting road runner is a vast departure compared to the other two, who maintain a similar physique to the originals. And honestly? I love it for it.

Galarian Zapdos works aesthetically and doesn't squander it's creativity. It has a unique, unexpected typing that is conveyed very well by it's design, and the design itself is an incredible improvement. Adding black feathers to finally break up the monotony of Zapdos' wings was a perfect decision, as was making the feathers smaller and more plentiful, to be less awkwardly large, looking far more feasible and realistic. It gives a texture to Galarian Zapdos whereas regular Zapdos just screamed cartoon with how exaggeratedly large each spike was, which couldn't possibly each be one feather.

Yeah, I have to dock points due to the randomness and oddity of these forms even existing in the first place. But I can't deny this thing actually is a kick ass design that I genuinely like, and while it only had a short time to do things in the Crown Tundra, it still felt like more than the original birds to me. A solid **B Tier**, I like it a lot.

[Fanart by Noeleart, round tres!](https://preview.redd.it/vcq8fr510eba1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1691ca9d622409a35fee5eb21ec2570e5435ccef)

**146: Moltres**

Just so you all know, I am aware that the Legendary Birds are named after Uno, Dos, and Tres, being the last few letters of their names. I saved mentioning the trivia for here, because I don't really know how much I can come up with right now.

I know every fan of Moltres is about to groan as I repeat the age old cliche but. It's true? Moltres looks like a rubber chicken that's on fire. Always has, every generation that's gone by, it looks worse and worse, ages more and more poorly. But even it's official art since the beginning has failed to make it look halfway intimidating and not like a complete joke.

Heck, the fanart I picked barely even resembles Moltres - the artist practically redesigned it and made it look so so much better. I really only used this one to complete the trifecta.

Anyway uh, Moltres looks dumb and stupid and the fact that it's supposed to be a Legendary really lowered the bar of that definition before we started getting ten Legendaries a generation. It's a waste of the most obvious concept of a Phoenix, so much so that we got Ho-oh to do it's job but better. **D Tier**, I don't like this thing.

[Fanart by XieXieYi](https://preview.redd.it/d77zqsi20eba1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0aed5d6033829159c9ab40d77b7385d094984da0)

**146\*: Galarian Moltres**

Hate to end my longest post ever on a bit of a wimper. Galarian Moltres... has a neat color scheme, but I don't put it on as much of a pedestal as it's kin. For one, black and pink was done to death in Gen 8 with Team Yell (ugh), but mostly it's just... not as good all around.

Unlike the other two, Galarian Moltres doesn't visually convey it's type very well. Sure, it has black on it and it's edgier, but so are all of the Galarian Legendary Birds. The new color, Pink, is still represented in fire effects, and has nothing to do with the Dark Type, it even gives off light. Psychic, Fighting, and Dark form an rock paper scissors trio but it's not like that was a requirement, since Ice, Lightning and Fire didn't do that.

What's more is that there's a lot of Moltres' derpiness left over. The awkward beak and hair, the way too small wings with transparent fire replacing the feathers that just does not work... It works better here cause the magenta flames are denser but it's not perfect. On it's own, I think this could be a C+ design, it's kind of ominous - it eminates a more legendary energy than any of the other six. But there's just so many problems lingering with all the Galar Birds existence, and the added descrepencies just weigh it down even further. 

I think it all averages out... somewhere in the dead of average. **C Tier**, though higher than Zapdos. I'll always take complicated and messy over boring and forgettable. That's just my eternal subjective preference.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm really, really failing to do this daily. I keep saying I'll get back into it but it's hard to find the energy during break. I'm sorry about the inconsistencies of these posts, and how I keep having to do these three in ones to catch up. But I hope the size of this post makes it up for the few who do follow this.

I'd love for this to start a longer discussion about the Legendary Birds. Which one's your favorite? Do you hate the Galar Birds for existing like some of my friends, or can you appreciate their designs? I know I have a wildly strong preference here, but that just makes me all the more eager to hear contrary opinions and see why people might actually like Moltres. (Sorry)

Tomorrow, I'll get back on track with the Pseudo Legend. Hope to see you there!

Most of the games were about avenging family, finding out about someone's past, with some side fun activities such as flirting and stuff and pieces of Eden was just there as a cherry on top. In general previous games felt much more story rich to me. 

Meanwhile all I remember from syndicate is just... Well there is a dude who rules over London and we are gonna be just working all the time as partisan group gradually lowering his influence. 

It didn't feel like any of the protagonists were putting any mind into it. Evie was all about pieces of Eden, Jacob was all about having fun with the boys. It didn't feel like anyone cared about the goal at all. When I tried to immerse myself into the game every part of main story felt more like a chore than without a final goal.

This game is great when the gameplay is good but for me it‚Äôs far more common that it‚Äôs bad than it is good. It took me a long time to realise it wasn‚Äôt the way I was playing or my tactics. It‚Äôs just that my opponents AI, regardless of cards, is much better than mine. 

I‚Äôm div 4 after the reset and I‚Äôve gotten to 14 wins on WL so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad player and can objectively tell when it‚Äôs me or the game. 



I won‚Äôt be buying it next year due to to discrepancies in gameplay. Just curious why people who experience this return to this game. Is it just addiction? The brief few games where the gameplay is good that keep you‚Äôs returning?",thesims,neg

FIFA,Possible fix for slow/sluggish gameplay,"I found a quick fix, that obviously won't work for everyone, but it improved my gameplay responsiveness on FUT from completely unplayable to somewhat enjoyable.

I have uninstalled the game last weekend, probably for the 10th time this year as I was so upset that I couldn't pass, defend, shoot, or mark. Every movement was so delayed that the game was unplayable. The odd thing is that I had this issue regularly, regardless of the time of the day or game mode.

After uninstalling, I've decided to change the settings on my xbox series s and turn on HDR as I thought about prioritizing the quality of the image and start playing other games. The xbox was oddly not allowing me to turn HDR + on saying my TV wasn't compatible, which I know for a fact wasn't right.

I went to check my HDMIs and noticed the xbox was plugged in to HDMI 2 and decided to plug it to HDMI 1, which is the main on my Samsung.

I was then able to turn on HDR and instantly my responsiveness on the xbox menu improved. I was shocked and decided to reinstall FIFA to test. To my surprise, I was finally able to pass, shoot and get back on winning.

I hope that helps someone out there.",pokemon,neg
thesims,All my Newcrest lots have disappeared,"I've been working on a Newcrest save file for a few days. Obviously I'm not very far along, just 2 houses, 3 community lots and 3 families. This afternoon I attempted to redownload TOOL and Better Build/Buy thinking they had been fixed from the patch. They hadn't, and when I loaded in to the main menu (I did not open the save) and saw the UI glitching out, I quickly exited the game to remove the mod, then reopened it, to where everything seemed fine. My lots were there, nothing was glitchy, etc.

Then I went to make a family, and once I'd finished every single lot disappeared. I don't know if this would've happened in all the worlds, since they'd all had their lots bulldozed already by me, but my Newcrest world view looks like this, and when I load into a lot the houses are definitely gone (and my Sims money, but I don't care about cheating for money). I've repaired my game, but it didn't help. I guess this is on me for not saving my builds to my library, but I just hate doing that for some reason.

pokemon,My perfect Pok√©mon game,"My perfect Pok√©mon game would be a remake of heart gold/soul silver, with the same game engine (or whatever it‚Äôs called) that‚Äôs been used in the newer games, with a hefty mix of all the new Pok√©mon that we‚Äôve gotten over the last 10 years. 

Only so many Pok√©mon from other games will be available in the game between the two regions we get to explore, (Kanto and Johto respectively) but a good amount from each existing region will be available in the base game. However all Pok√©mon will be obtainable via trade, so people can complete their pokedexes and have access to otherwise unavailable Pok√©mon that you won‚Äôt see in a standard playthrough. 

Buddy Pok√©mon make a return, just like they were in HG/SS, one of your Pok√©mon will follow you on your journey (toggle-able) 

NPCs, such as gym leaders and other important figures will pose a real challenge again. No more cheesing your way through child‚Äôs play anymore. This includes NPC trainers having access to a wider selection of Pok√©mon, as well as being able to carry more than 1-2 at a time. For example, mid game you‚Äôll start encounter standard route trainers who could have 4 or more Pok√©mon. Also EXP. Share is toggle-able. 

Lots of fun side content, such as contests, sports, and tournaments to occupy and challenge you and your Pok√©mon in. Trainers from all over the world come to participate in these, as well as multiplayer to challenge and play with other players in real time!  It‚Äôll help with making the world feel more alive

Of the new features that have been included over the years, Mega evolution makes its return as the dominant feature. Z moves and/or Gigantamax can be post game features, or just not included at all. I‚Äôd also really love it if being able to ride Pok√©mon would make a return for this game too! Poke Pelago is a must have

Returning characters from other games make appearances through the core game and post game. Such as Cynthia, Sycamore and N being a few that I would love to see. 

Neo Team Plasma makes a return as post game content, either from a dlc or something that was already included in the vanilla game. They‚Äôve been my favorite evil team ever since I first played BW/BW2. They don‚Äôt arrive in force however, but are operating in small teams through out kanto and/or johto looking for something‚Ä¶. Legendary. 

Last but certainly not least, HM moves make a return as well. They will be needed to unlock and progress to certain areas, like how it used to be! 

This is just everything from the top of my head. I really loved and miss the older generation games and what they had to offer but I also enjoy what we have now, putting them all together into one big remake of some of my favorite Pok√©mon games ever would be a dream come true. 

But of course this is all that it is, a dream.",legostarwars,pos

thesims,Apartment Issue: Non controlled sims never entering their apartments?,"Long short here given the issue and age of the game, but I can't find any other help relating to this issue that works, so I figured I'd give y'all a try.

I recently built an apartment complex in the Sims 2 Ultimate Edition, and I've been having some issues. The complex has 12 units, 4 of which are occupied by controllable families, and one of which is a townie.  First, and most pressingly, is that my any sims not in my currently controlled family never enter their apartments if I swap to a different family. Say I'm playing family 1 - families 2, 3, and 4 will continuously hang around in the communal area, eventually falling asleep, wetting themselves and fighting constantly. I've downloaded the FFS Batbox and tried fixing bad apartment residencies, but it always returns 0 errors. I've also downloaded MidgeTheTree's apartment move out and dormie fix, which seems intended to tackle a similar issue, but hasn't resolved this particular problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, only one townie has moved in to the apartment complex. I assume the game has some kind of limit on the number of residents there can be and I know expecting 12 apartments to be filled may be asking a little much, but I did expect more than 1 to move in.

legostarwars,"If a Republic Gunship does come out this year, what would you want the minifig selection to be?","Given how there are rumors of a play scale LAAT Gunship coming out sometime soon, I‚Äôm wanting to know what people would want the selection of minifigs to be. I have a few ideas of what Lego could go for that I would personally enjoy to see. These selections aren‚Äôt of any specific quantities, but just what would be nice to have at least one of in each set:

1.  501st-based: Following even further up on the successes of the 501st Battlepacks, I could imagine the Gunship would include Clone Wars Anakin, some generic 501st clones, the return of the 501st pilot clone, (the last and only 501st pilot we got was back in 2013 with set 75004), and most importantly, a modern version of Phase 2 Captain Rex. This would be the most likely way Lego would go about it based on their patterns with clone releases, but obviously it‚Äôs too soon to be certain. 

2. Mostly generic clones: Lego could also opt to just do generic white Phase 2 clones, with a generic clone pilot based on the 501st pilot‚Äôs helmet mold, but still throw in Phase 2 Captain Rex. This would give everyone the ability to get those generic white phase 2‚Äôs that everyone has been asking for more of, while still providing unique minifigs like Rex and clone pilot(s). Maybe some sort of named Jedi would be thrown in, but it‚Äôs up to Lego on this one. 

3. 2003 Clone Wars based: This is the least likely to happen, but not impossible by any means since it‚Äôs the Clone Wars anniversary, and Lego has made a 2003 set before (75087). If Lego opted to do this set, they could use the white Phase 1 clones they made for 40558, and also then subsequently include modern renditions of the blue Clone Lieutenants, as well as a red Clone Captain to represent Fordo (or, preferably, just straight up have him be a named character in the set). They‚Äôd also likely throw in a Phase 1 clone pilot for the gunship, and/or an Obi-Wan minifigure since Fordo was under his command in the show. 

I‚Äôm curious to hear what everyone else thinks would end up happening, or what they‚Äôd prefer to see.

CallOfDuty,I have a few questions in regards to Ghosts and MW19 split screen [GHOSTS] [COD],"I am not sure if this should go on this reddit or the r/modernwarfare reddit and I know this is long but anyways
I have been trying to make up my mind between Ghosts and MW19 as they are both on sale atm on ps store and was leaning towards MW19 but apparantly there is barely any split screen support, no infected split screen (infected is a deal breaker for me), no spec-ops split screen, no survival split screen, no campaign split screen (this idm that much) and lastly online splitscreen I heard is very limited/non existant since MW2(22) came out I'm  really not sure about this tho, I just read it somewhere one of the call of duty reddits.
I would appreciate if someone could confirm if these are true because I would prefer MW19 if it had the split screen implemented in the mentioned modes, and I know Ghosts has most of these options in split screen. The problem being Ghosts I have heard is pretty bad overall, one of the least favoured CODs but if it has the modes and MW19 doesn't I'll choose Ghosts",pokemon,pos

The instant that round 1 starts, my opponent is hit with 4 lines of garbage and the board shakes as if they were hit.  My APM/VS scores remain at 0, so it isn't an attack from me.  I didn't see this in any other rounds, just round 1.

Anyone else experience this?  Is this a known bug?

pokemon,If we get Legends Kyurem should it take place in the far future instead of the past?,"So a lot of people speculate that we'll get either a Legends Celebi or Legends Kyurem eventually. Based on what I've seen most hope/expect for a Legends Kyurem game, thinking that it'll be about the conflict between the 2 brothers that split the original dragon in the first place. However if we do end up getting a Legends Kyurem game, then I believe that it might actually take place in the future and not the past. And there are 2 reasons why I think this could be a possibility:

1. The whole theme of Scarlet and Violet is Past and Future. From the perspective of these games we had a Legends game about the past in the past, so making a game about the future in the future, would be fitting. This could even tie into the DLC if they time it right, making the hisui forms available in Scarlet and the new forms from Legends Kyurem in Violet eventually (of course all would be transferrable via home in either game).
2. The whole draw of a Legends Kyurem game would be to give us the original dragon and you'd expect a big showdown with said dragon at the end of the game. However the whole point of the backstory with the 2 brothers was that the dragon was split during the conflict and it stayed that way since then. So if we got a game that takes place during that time, then Kyurem would start in the original dragon form, then split and then never reform, which would be rather awkward to end on that (unless we enter alternate-timeline territory whichadmittedly isn't out of the question). However a game in the future could deal with a story where Kyurem actually reforms. EDIT: Apparently the 2 heroes did reconcile eventually but their sons continued the conflict, I guess this could work in a Legends game with Kyurem becoming whole again when the brothers reconcile and their sons splitting it up again some time between Legends and B/W. Might be a bit of a mood killer to think the peace you achieve in that game won't last, but it would only matter if you are familiar with the lore.

Wich generation should I start again with? I played the 4 firsts generation in this order (Crystal, Emerald, Green Leaf and Pearl), as you can see the order it's not important for me.  

I receive a Nintendo Switch. From the 5th generation to the last one, which is, in your opinion, the best? For me, if we talk about the generations that I've played, the best one was 2nd generation with Crystal (maybe because I was a kid...), which one is the most similar to the 2nd?

FinalFantasy,Thoughts on Party Splitting,"How do y‚Äôall feel about FF game segments that force you to split the party (either splitting your main 4 or making multiple parties of all of your characters). Personally, and I know people will disagree, I don‚Äôt like it and I never do. I feel like the great thing about FF games with big casts is choosing who you like, both their character and their abilities, and using them. I understand that developers want you to utilize your entire party and get to know characters you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise, and I respect that. But I feel like that‚Äôs what multiple playthroughs are for. No one spends time (at least not on their first playthrough) levelling every character, so it‚Äôs unfair to suddenly make every character count, ESPECIALLY in/near the endgame. FF6 especially always gets on my nerve; I‚Äôve had to restart the game cuz I messed up the final dungeon and simply couldn‚Äôt progress. Yes, it‚Äôs partially my fault, but I don‚Äôt like the mechanic. Or take games like 7; splitting up the party in the late game and forcing you to use character you might not have used just seems like it‚Äôs asking for you to get stuck. I will say though that 9 does it very well; it happens near the beginning and is sequenced so that you‚Äôre switching back and forth between a couple scenarios, so it feels more balanced and you will get to play with characters you like for a while. Sorry for the rambling post, but what does everyone else think of this mechanic? (Also sorry it‚Äôs probably not an original concept for a post!)",thesims,pos

pokemon,New to EV training and need advice (Gen 9),"Hello, everybody. So, I'm an avid pokemon player and have been since I was very little, but I've never cared for EVs and IVs until now. I'm working on rebuilding my S/V team with the perfect natures and EVs and the advice I need is not the EV training itself but rather how do I decide which EVs to get? For example, my starter was Skeledirge who had a BST of 530 broken into HP - 104, Atk - 75, Defense - 100, Sp. Atk. - 110, Sp. Def.- 75, and Spd. - 66. Going for a ""perfect"" EV Skeledirge, do I put EVs into his most prominent stats of HP and Sp. Atk. or do I put them towards his weakest stats of Spd and Sp. Def.? I know videos exist but no vids touch on this specific detail and I want to know if anybody can help me to decide on this. I understand natures and all and I know what natures I have planned, I just need help with this EV problem. Thanks to all who answer!",pokemon,pos

Would it be more like FF7R where they change the turn based game into an action game and add combos but then rewrite the plot and change almost everything about it? Or would it be more in line with other Square remakes like Crisis Core or Trials of Mana where the game gets improvements like upgraded graphics, faster combat/battles, etc, but most of the core story elements stay the same?

thesims,Random families on a newly created Sunset Valley save.,"So I just wanted to start a new save, loaded up Sunset Valley, and noticed that there are several seemingly random new families populating not only the vacant houses, but also empty lots and community lots (how is that even possible?!). I believe three of them were named Landgraab. I manually deleted all of them, but I don‚Äôt know if this will have any long-term effects on my save. This issue is prevalent on every new save I create, though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs exclusive to Sunset Valley.

Any idea what could cause that, or even better, how to fix that? I do play with some mods, but I haven‚Äôt installed any new ones in a while, besides I don‚Äôt think a simple mod could do that kind of thing.

Edit: Just found a family named ‚ÄòMaleGhosts‚Äô living on a junkyard, and a toddler living all by herself in an elixir store. There is also a single sim named ‚ÄòGothGhosts‚Äô inhabiting an empty lot, so could this mean all of the families are Sunset Valley‚Äôs ghosts, that somehow got resurrected and placed in the world?",FIFA,pos

FIFA,Why did they decide to remove the B button?,"I‚Äôm not the best at the game, I sit in Div 3 for friendlies and OG every few games but I probably would stall out at Div 1. My gameplay style has always been box to box games. When the opponent gets the ball I rush him, press B and if I don‚Äôt take it he might score, if I do I run to his box, it is what it is (I was pretty accurate at using the B button, even tho it‚Äôs risky I‚Äôd still get &gt;12 WL wins a week). I play very high pace games so I keep interested.

However, it appears that the B button no longer works. I didn‚Äôt know an update was coming out but I noticed the gameplay difference  today and looked it up to discover they patched the game overnight. My entire play style is now gone and opponents are spinning in circles biding their time and playing like snails trying to impersonate Antony. 

Needless to say, my dopamine levels while playing this awful new game have dropped significantly because I can‚Äôt do fast paced gameplay anymore as the B button has been removed.",FinalFantasy,neg

pokemon,[FR/LG] I'm surprised I never found anyone referencing the legendary dogs event in Route 23,"First of all, I'm not crazy xD. I saw that as a child/teen, while playing Leaf Green on an emulator, but I didn't take a screenshot at the time, nor I managed to reproduce that event, so I don't know the exact circunstances that reproduce it.

Route 23 is divided in a few segments:

* the portion after Victory Road's exit;
* the portion before Victory Road's entrance, where you can already see the cave, that includes a small grass field;
* the grass field portion, with 4 small grass fields and some rocks;
* the water portion;
* and the empty portion, which is connected to Route 22.

I was running around the grass field portion, bored, looking for items in the ground. At some point, Suicune (which was the legendary dog available for me to find at the time, since I've picked Charmander as my starter) appeared about 3 blocks ahead of my character, coming from the right side of the screen. It looked at my character, growled, then disappeared in the left side of the screen. Also, I'm pretty sure that after that event, Suicune was added to my Pokedex, as seen, which meant I could look for it around Kanto using the Pokedex without stumbling with him in the tall grass first.

I have no idea if that event only occurs in Route 23, nor if it only happens in a specific block, although both guesses seem very likely imo.

Also, I'm not sure if there was a Suicune overworld sprite looking at the left/right when he appeared/disappared, or if some kind of effect was used instead, since what really stuck to my mind was the fact that Suicune was there, 3 blocks ahead, growling at my character, in Route 23. Other details may be imprecise.

And I also have no idea if the GBA file I was using at the time was hacked in some kind of way, but I still have it, so if anyone wants me to get a hash of the file, to check if it's altered or not, I can do it.

Also, unfortunately, I don't have a save state for a moment after it appeared, since after it vanished, I loaded my most recent save state, hoping I would be able to reproduce what I did and see it again, because, since no battle was triggered, I thought ""I must have done something wrong"".

I also want to check that portion of the map with Advance Map at some point, but I wanted to sure if anyone else has seen that as well.

At that point in the game, I had already beaten Elite Four, but I hadn't captured Suicune, nor had I stumbled with it in the tall grass. If there is any other relevant information I can provide, I will do my best.

**EDIT:** English is not my first language, so I'm not sure if ""growl"" is the correct word. I heard Suicune's cry, and there was a dialog box with a text representing the cry sound.",CallOfDuty,neg

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for validation in feeling like they put no time into honoring Palkia‚Äôs original design, and put it and Dialga on the back burner (rip Dialga too for different reasons). Such a shame because of how good a lot of other pokemon design additions and redesigns can be. I wish I could just stop caring but Palkia has been such a favorite of mine for well over a decade, and having this horse centuar thing take the stage as Palkia‚Äôs ‚Äútrue‚Äù form is still jarring and I can‚Äôt seem to accept its real lmao. Now I‚Äôm just curious what form will take precedence in the future. I know Giratina Origin Forme has kind of taken the stage as representing Giratina in media and the TCG and whatnot. My only hope for the future is that whenever Palkia and Dialga are represented in media, they retain their 2007 forms.

But no, now that I replayed every major game I came to the conclusion that heartgold and soulsilver are pretty mid pokemon games, super lackluster story, pokemon variety and terrible level curves.

assassinscreed,"finished the non DLC part of Valhalla. gotta say, they did what I thought was impossible, im now invested in the modern day part (spoilers).","*Finished aside from the order of ancients part.

So I've always just liked the games for the historical aspect. Didn't hate Desmonds moderns stuff, but even then I'd have preferred to just be Ezio or Connor the whole time. Since AC3 ended, I haven't cared about it at all (aside from the Fate of Atlantis parts, I actually really was digging Leylas story in that).

They did the one combo of things that could draw me in. Establish the modern protagonist as both a true reincarnation of an Isu with all the memories and everything intact (and probably the most fun Isu possible to be), and also firmly root him as a character from the past before making him the future protagonist. My jaw literally dropped when Basim picked up the staff and was revealed as the new modern day main Character, I'm actually almost more interested in the modern parts than the historical parts now looking forward at Mirage.

If you'd told me even a week ago that soon I'd care about the non animus sections, I'd have called you crazy. Whole new light now. Just hoping they don't fully abandon the Origins/Odyssey/Valhalla formula, obviously I like old school AC so I'm excited to see it return, but the new RPG style has elevated the series from ""freaking awesome must plays"" to ""arguably my favorite game series of all time"", it was perfect in Odyssey imo, so hoping eventually we get another similar to that. Perfect middle ground imo is alternating releases between Old School style and RPG style.",FinalFantasy,pos

pokemon,What if Red was in the Masters Eight? (Lore&amp;Team),"**PREMISE**  
I'm sure someone else thought about this, as if this occurred in the game-world Red would've totally joined. But can he beat it?  
Especially when you think he's lore-accurately in him mid 30s by now, with Cynthia likely in her 40s.  
Are these seasoned Trainers any stronger now?  
TBF, in Alola, Blue says ""We were both Champions of the Kanto region, *in our own days"".*  
So... *Who would win? Who's stronger? Leon, Cynthia or Red?*

While I can't answer this question... I can tell you this post *is about:*  
*Chairman Rose asking himself the same question*, and putting up a Masters Eight Tournament in Sword and Shield. Game-Canon, before Leon got dethroned.

[Fake Scan I made so it looks a SwSh DLC - art by me](https://preview.redd.it/kyodr7m04lfa1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0afea889691320355d0ec2dff4e0397c393075cb)

**LORE DEVELOPMENT**

RED AND BLUE AFTER THE ALOLAN BATTLE TREE  
The Pok√©mon World Tournament in BW2, the Battle Tree, and now Masters Eight - it's only natural for him to recieve an invitation for this last event as well.  
But... Red is collecting one loss after another. Must be frustrating. As Blue implied, they're both past their prime at this point. But to quote Blue again, ""*Look, I'm a Trainer. So, if I see another strong Trainer, I'm gonna want to fight them"" -* and I can't imagine Red having a different opinion.

CHAIRMAN ROSE INVITATION  
Looking at the PWT, I think only Red would receive and invitation - not Blue.  
He's not a kid anymore, and will surely help Red so both regain their former glory - ""*You have to show them what top Kanto Trainers can do!*""  
Kantonian brands would surely love to have Red wear their logos, as sponsors...  
And with a new spark and will to win, Mega Evolution, Z-Moves and (looking at Red in Masters EX and Lance in the anime) Dynamax at his disposal... Red is finally ready to give the undefeated Galar Champion a run for his money.

**THE TEAM**  
I gave Red's Team the same Levels they had in HGSS - implying a return to his prime.And, most notably, swapped **Lapras** for **Espeon**. Throwback? ... Maybe. But more importantly he already has Blastoise *as a tanky Water Type,* let's add some variety.  
Charizard is his strongest Mega option, plus 4 of his Pok√©mon eat the Max Soup, to add more flexibility to this team, making it less predictable.  
But ideally, I picture **Snorlax** being sent out for last and Maxed.

https://preview.redd.it/c7t528tj5lfa1.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bbc0963da287e1245acc9bd1937c5c59ec43c8c6

**PIKACHU(G-Max) - Lightningrod - Light Ball - Lv.88**  
\[Fake Out\] \[Volt Tackle\] \[Knock Off\] \[Extremespeed\]

Lead of the team, it acts as a wallbreaker and initial damage dealer.  
Fake out to chip/stall, VoltTackle to deal massive damage and KnockOff to damage who resists Electric attacks. Extremespeed to finish off.  
Not the strongest pick, but a fun start for the battle - it can Gigantamax to last a bit longer if Pikachu is strong against the opponent's team and/or to Paralyze specific targets.  
Allowing who's in the back to outspeed and make crucial plays.

&gt;MOVESET TRIVIA  
The rarest Pikachu, barley legal as Idk if you can obtain it like this in-game due to trading-limitations between generations. But this is how you obtain these moves:  
Extremespeed via a Gen5 event - KnockOff&amp;VoltTackle by tutoring in Gen7 - FakeOut by NurseryTransferance in Gen8 - Hidden Ability and Gmax form with Gen8's DLC items.  
&gt;  
&gt;This ""Red's Pikachu"" Would make for a FANTASTIC event Pok√©mon.

**VENUSAUR (G-Max) - Clorophyll - Wide Lens - Lv.82**  
\[Sleep Powder\] \[Leech Seed\] \[Giga Drain\] \[Sludge Bomb\]

Pretty self explainatory set. Let me just point out that, thanks to Wide Lens, Sleep Powder and Leech Seed now have 82.5% and 99% accuracy. Crucial to make Venusaur more consistent.  
Gigantamax is a secondary option, in situations where Vinelash's DOTs are crucial. And since setting sun is common with Dynamax, Clorophyll is a nice counterplay.

**BLASTOISE (G-Max) - Torrent - Leftovers - Lv.82**  
\[Scald\] \[Ice Beam\] \[Yawn\] \[Rapid Spin\]

Tanky and stally. Rapid Spin is to aid Charizard against Stealth Rocks, and Torrent is better than Rain Dish to boost Scald when in a pinch - especially if Gigantamaxed.  
This Blastoise is Red's second-best Max option, DOTs are always welcomed and Max Strike even adds some needed speed control options to this team.

**ESPEON - Magic Bounce - Normalium Z - Lv.80**  
\[Stored Power\] \[Dazzling Gleam\] \[Celebrate\] \[Shadow Ball\]

Just like Pikachu, this moveset is technically unobtainable. But *kinda* legal.  
Thanks to Magic Bounce you can freely set-up in front of hazard setters. Z-Celebrate immediately boosts everyone of Espeon's stats, making it faster/stronger/tankier at the same time. This also means that Stored Power now has 120 Base Power. STAB. Dazzling Gleam and Shadow Ball are there to cover Psychic resistances. Such an interesting set.

&gt;MOVESET TRIVIA  
Celebrate is obtained via event - the rest through TMs or items.

**CHARIZARD - Blaze - Charizardite X - Lv.84**  
\[Dragon Claw\] \[Flare Blitz\] \[Dragon Dance\] \[Earthquake\]

Red's Mega Pok√©mon, and physical sweeper.  
Not much to say about this Pokemon, we all know how strong it is.

**SNORLAX - Gluttony - Figy Berry - Lv.82**  
\[Body Slam\] \[Crunch\] \[Belly Drum\] \[Recycle\]

Red's primary Max-Option, quite literally a Raid Boss if Maxed after a Belly Drum.  
You know the thing, BellyDrum reduces the HP in half but quadruples the Atk - Gluttony kicks in and the Berry is consumed early, bringing Snorlax back at full HP. Once Maxed, Snorlax's G-Max Replenish will recycle the Berry.

**CONCLUSION**  
IMO, this is Red's Team at its absolute best. Surely a worthy challenger even for a lore-stated unbeatable Champion like Leon.",FIFA,neg

According to Bulbapedia, ""They are said to embody the three events that happened to the tower: the lightning that struck the tower, the fire that burned in the tower, and the winds and rain that put it out.""


So, it seems that they didn't exist in their current forms before Ho-oh revived them (not the in-game revive, but the actual revival from death).¬†

FinalFantasy,FF1 Challenge Party Pixel Remaster.,"I made it a challenge for the year to play through as many of the mainline entries in the series as possible. As a fan from the SNES days I've played through all of the games prior to VI  excluding V at least once. 

I've probably beaten FFI a half dozen times on both the PS and the Pixel Remaster. Usually I use a balanced party (Fighter, Monk or Thief, White Mage, Red Mage). I think the first time through I subbed out the White Mage for a Red Mage. This time around I'm looking for a challenge. 

A couple of nights ago I started with 2 Red Mages, a White Mage and a Black Mage. I'm currently in the elf kingdom grinding for gill to buy a few more 4th level spells before tackling the Marsh Cave. The characters are all level 15. 

My questions are these:

How essential is it to get the class change early? Will I be totally screwed in the endgame if I don't shift to wizards ASAP?

What is the minimum level for this party to take out Chaos? Traditionally I've gone up against him somewhere between 40th and 50th level but that was with significantly more HP for the Knight and attack power with the Master? I'm guessing that with this party I probably want to be closer to 75 or even 99. 

I'd also like to take down Warmech (if I can find it). Is that even possible with this party and, if so, what level should I be to attempt it?",FIFA,pos

But she's super shy, and says most of the time she's tried talking about her favorite assassin with friends or on other online forums it just turns into people hating on Connor and AC3. As a result, she's a little self conscious about showing her art of her AC OC with him. I suggested searching Reddit, since there always seems some subreddit for something and I've generally seen more supportive communities in specific fandom subs, but she isn't all that familiar with it.


So I thought I'd ask on her behalf what the general stance in this sub is toward him/3 and OCs before encouraging her to just toss them here.


Thank you in advance!",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,Catching Feebas in BDSP is the culmination of everything wrong with Pokemon RNG,"Not only BDSP went back to old habits with random encounters being the main way of finding pokemon, even though SwSh and PLA had made great progress on that matter, they also hid Feebas the worst way they could possible think of. It's found only in a single location in the game, and it is only found while fishing, which has a chance of not getting a bite. Also, it's very likely not to be found near the surface, which is the most intuitive place to fish. You can't even fish on the same spot because it's locked to 2 single squares per day. 2 out of a 18x34 tile arrange, which gives you a a 0.3% change of fishing in the right spot. This, if you happen to have a pokemon with sucction cups. If you didn't know about that trick, your chances are even lower, and even so, there's a 50% chance you get another random pokemon instead. So you basically have something around 1 in 1000 chance to find Feebas, which, being more realistic, since most people will only fish near the surface, should be much, much lower.

I wouldn't be that mad about this if it weren't for the fact that very talented people managed to write code that calculates the squares Feebas possible are, reducing them to 4 possibilities, based on your Loto-ID ticket number. The company's response to this? They decided to further complicate RNG so this calculator became obsolete. Now, you need at least 2 lotto tickets, which means you would have to skip a day if you wanna find Feebas faster. But what happens if you skip a day? Not only you get locked out of time-based events, you also are unable to get the ticket and have yo wait for 24 hours to get your stupid tile locations. Even so, it's not always garanteed.

So, instead of fixing the control problems with the game, they chose to fix RNG abuse for an extremely stupid encounter. That's what they would rather spend their time and money with. I work with applied maths and I've done the math. Here it is. Assume the following:

- Fishing, hooking, encountering a pokemon and then running away takes 40 seconds average;
- You would attempt fishing at least twice on the same tile.

The probability of not finding Feebas in the n-th tile is (n-1)/n (probability of not being the correct tile) + 1/n * 1/4 (probability of being the correct tile and you not encountering it twice. Given that, [here](https://gist.github.com/fpmuniz/1a5612e741f6b5dc2e414249de9fc6fd) is the script I wrote to calculate your odds.

It takes an average of 8h12m to find a Feebas, giving you a 50.09% chance of finding it, which means it takes you 8h to flip a coin to see if you will find it. It takes 6h48m to run across half the tiles, giving you even lower odds - 40.51% chance, which is less than the flip of a coin.

Again, they chose to keep players doing this stupid grind instead of actually making the gameplay more pleasant. I guess more overall gametime means nintendo sees it as a good game and invests on it more? I can't think of a better reason to hide a pokemon behind such stupid RNG. I've done shiny hunts that took less than an hour. RNG is supposed to make a game fun, not to make it drag on. I accept some difficulty to find a pokemon, but this? This is insulting, specially in a game that is all about ""catching them all"".

Feel free to play around the numbers in my gist or to adjust accordingly. Maybe I overestimated the 40 seconds, and I definitely overlooked the fact that some tiles are not accessible (there are rocks there), but I found them to be negligible. Those variables are easily ajustable at the beginning of the script.

Anyways sorry for the long rant, TL;DR: it takes an average of 8h to find a Feebas in BDSP and they firmly stand by this decision by fighting time travel cheeses and updating anti-cheese instead of improving QoL.",thesims,pos

FinalFantasy,What is best to play after FFVII for a Final Fantasy newbie,"Hello all!!

I know this is a question this sub gets a lot, but I was wondering what the best game to ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù the final fantasy series would be having had VII be my first experience of the franchise?

For some context, I got interested in VII when the Remake was released, absolutely loved that game to death and then ended up buying the original so that I could experience the full story before Rebirth. I have since also played Crisis Core and watched Advent Children because I just love these characters so much. 

But now I‚Äôm ready to experience the rest of the series! I was initially just going to play them in numerical order, but I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôd actually quite like to prioritise the ones that people think have the best story/character experience seeing as that‚Äôs what I loved the most about VII. The ones I‚Äôm currently eyeing up at XV (even though I know it‚Äôs a bit of a divisive game amongst the community, it still looks like something I‚Äôd enjoy) and X because I‚Äôve heard so much praise about it. I‚Äôd definitely also like to try and get into XIV at some point, though I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm quite ready to lose my life to that game üòÖ

Anyways enough rambling, what would you guys say? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get to all of them eventually, just very curious what the general opinion is! :)",thesims,pos
FinalFantasy,Looking for feedback from some FFX-2 players,"So I think most unanimously agree FFX is one of the best the series has ever done. Yes everyone will have their issues but that‚Äôs a pretty mind-blowing story and the concepts were super heavy for the age I‚Äôd imagine a lot of people were when they first experienced it.

My question or reason for this post is that I WANTED to like FFX-2 sooooo bad because X was so good. I think I maybe had it for like a week because for me it just did not land at all or even come close to what I had just played. So I didn‚Äôt give it a chance and got rid of it. 

I‚Äôve since revisited a lot of the Final Fantasy games both that I have played and beat, and haven‚Äôt. This is one of the ones I‚Äôm kind of avoiding but I still want to like it and I just don‚Äôt think I understand what‚Äôs going on enough to give it another shot. Just curious what players here thought that have enjoyed the game because I‚Äôd like to convince myself to try it again.",FIFA,pos

Personally, I've always been disappointed that it isn't more accurate, and wish the anime was more like Origins or Generations. Origins got to tell the full story of Kanto through the lens of the games, and Generations is like the anime I've always wanted and its only flaw is that there isn't more of it.

GTA,"90s Colombia, 80s Miami, GTA VI: Theory/Idea","First of all the actual story and open world will be set in modern day 2020s Maimi, that is pretty much a given.
-
The idea I have considered is that you play one or more flashback missions that take place in Miami, maybe as yourselve or another character. With gta v we've seen the Rockstar's willingness to push the boundaries on what a gta protagonist or storyline looks like. We've seen this with the North Yankton mission in gta v.
-
One of the flashback scenarios would be Miami in the 1980s. Miami was seen as the gateway to Latin America and the Cocaine capital of the United States at the time. With the chaos and historic precedent that Miami set for the 80s this would be the key time to involve the storyline in some way. This is not to mention the pop culture references of Miami at the time, Scarface, Miami Vice, New wave and our very own gta Vice City. It wouldn't be open sandbox at this time but a closed mission or a few would be really cool.
-
The second location would be Colombia in the 1990s. In the late 20th century Colombia took the world's spotlight for being a country plunged into a violent drug war. With narcos, people like Pablo Escobar and other high profile figures have arose to popularity in American pop culture. Colombia at the time was also home to a violent political conflict between different political factions. Both of these facts could set the stage for a very interesting game dynamic in the 90s. You could get into shootouts with the drug cartels in the city and play a role in the gorilla warfare between different paramilitaries and gorillas. This like the Miami scenario wouldn't necessarily be open world but I could see an argument for a small village or countryside map that you're stuck in for a while.
-
The two flashback scenarios would play into eachother and help explain the current situation in modern Miami. Maybe a choice yoi male in the flashback would affect the storyline. Another cool idea would be to have the region in Colombia some how be accessible to the player in modern times. Also a return to the Colombian region in the modern storyline would make sense. Preferably at least 3 missions in each scenario so we can get a taste of the time setting and have our fun. Doing GTA VI like this would give us a practical fun modern setting that we can enjoy like GTA V and a bit of the flavor and nostalgia we are curious about. 
-
Bonus: I think having San Fiero with the bay area and Las Venturas would be cool too. Thanks.",pokemon,neg

This is a good example but many others. Especially evident in offline games like squad battles, the game becomes more stupid than intelligent.

pokemon,"If you could make one Pokemon game exist, what would it be?","I'd personally make X2/Y2 happen. Considering that the 3DS games' internal code had two games labeled ""Calos Reserve"", it tells me that these games were originally going to happen, but somewhere along the way, various obstacles got in the way of that possibility becoming reality. It's depressing that X/Y are the only games in the series (so far at least) to not get anything at all as a follow-up. My ideal vision for X2/Y2 includes several things:

1. Southern Kalos being fully expanded upon with newer areas
2. More Mega Evolutions, with a new type of mechanic specific to every starter and Mewtwo called ""Z Mega Stones"", where you can combine the X and Y Mega Stones to create Z ones
3. The ability to turn off roller skates and learn more new roller skating tricks
4. Obvious main Zygarde storyline involving all its forms (Core, 10%, 50% and Complete)
5. Neo Team Flare with &gt;!Malva !&lt;leading it
6. Eternal Floette and AZ having more prominence in the story
7. The Kalos mythicals, Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion having new locations tied to them (Diancie could have Reflection Cave, Hoopa could have somewhere in Southern Kalos, and Volcanion would obviously be tied to the Kalos Power Plant)
8. The ability to take off your hat and way more clothes options than before
9. Gym Leaders and Elite Four actually using Mega Evolutions plus having way better rematches than before
10. Several additions from newer games, like regional variants and Pokemon roaming in the overworld

There's more I can think of, but that's all for now. What Pokemon game would you go out of your way to make happen? I'm curious to know.",CallOfDuty,neg

Even after the reveal I kept thinking that maybe they'll retcon it by saying that real professor was stuck in the future all along, or he was controlling the robot body from somewhere else, and that was what added to the sorrow that I felt. It even made me fell bad for Arven, after all the struggles he finally gets to meet his father only to find that he was an AI.

The VGC format can be challenging, but with the right Pokemon on your team, you can dominate your opponents. Here are our top five picks for the most overpowered Pokemon in the VGC format:

Excadrill - Excadrill is a versatile Pokemon that can perform well in both offensive and defensive roles. Its Steel typing and strong Ground-type moves make it difficult to take down.
Dragapult - Dragapult has a high speed stat and can hit incredibly hard with its powerful Dragon-type moves.
Zacian-Crowned - Zacian-Crowned is a powerful Pokemon that can take down its opponents with its Steel-type moves and its ability Intrepid Sword, which increases its attack when it holds a steel-type item.
Magikarp - Wait, what? That's right! With the right setup, Magikarp can become one of the most overpowered Pokemon in the VGC format thanks to its ability Rattled, which increases its speed stat when hit by a super effective move.
Togekiss - Togekiss is a versatile Pokemon that can support its team with moves like Follow Me and its ability Serene Grace, which increases the chance of its moves' secondary effects occurring.
What's your favorite Pokemon to use in the VGC format? Let us know in the comments!",GTA,neg

It's downloaded past the 'ready to start' phase, but it's not fully downloaded as of yet.

The problem is, as soon as I go to load my previous saved game, it now pops up with a message saying the following:

""Missing Add-Ons
Your save requires some additional content to be installed before continuing.

Download the missing content?""

The problem is, I never bought any DLC's, I've just been playing the base game that was available via cloud gaming, and it doesn't even specify which content it wants me to download. I press 'yes' and it just takes me straight to the Store homepage without specifying which content it wants me to download.

I've tried doing a hard reset on the console, but it's still doing exactly the same thing.

CallOfDuty,[COD] Is Treyarch remastering Alpha Omega and Dead of the Night in 2024?,"I know rumors of ZC2 has been in the works for quite some time since BO4, but it hasn‚Äôt seen the light of day; however, I do feel that it will come in 2024. I know BO2 maps would be their priority; and despite Bo4 not being that fun to play, if there are any remasters of BO4 maps I think Alpha Omega and DOTD would be some bangers, they were the best ones to me. Alpha Omega already had plenty of lore and awesome easter eggs as well as the map being expanded in a great way and Dead of the Night imo could take advantage of a remaster. I love Dead of the Night because it is the only map that had Zombies, Werewolves, and Vampires in one map which I think check out for a full on horror map. The only problem I have is that is is missing the Verruckt theme, which was actually the closest to a real horror map. I think Dead of the Night could use a remaster/reimagining by making the mansion abandoned, expanding the haunted forest, and making it horrorlike Verruckt. After all, it also had ghosts. If Treyarch could see this I think they can make ZC2 the best dlc we‚Äôve ever had. I know some Bo3 maps deserve remasters but I‚Äôve always opted for scary maps. I do feel Shadows of Evil could use some of these elements as well, but who can argue one of the most iconic maps of all time.",assassinscreed,pos

Swampert might be the most offensive-defensive pokemon ever, that thing tanks and kills anything that is not grass.

Surf, Earthquake, Ice beam, a move of your choice, with any nature that doesn't lower atk or sp. Atk, holding any item that boosts water or ground type (or nevermelt Ice if you are paranoid about grass or dragons)

Manectric only needs Thunderbolt and a nature that doesn't screw neither sp.atk or speed

In the early game the only problem might be shroomish, but since mudkip is not ground type yet, it tanks. Just have extra potions and berries 

First gym is Roxanne - no comments needed 

Second Gym is Brawly - here Mudkip should be Marshtomp already. No problems at all, it tanks smoothly. 

Then it comes Wattson - no comments needed 

Then Flannery - no comments needed 

Norman might be one of the hardest challenges (not that the game is that hard anyway). I always use few pokemons the entire journey so here I already had Swampert. Your task is to save him for Slaking. Even tho that psychopath sloth has crazy hp and attack stat, Norman is screwed because Swampert will tank anything and deal a lot of damage while Slaking is unable to move. If anything you use potions 

Next is Winona. I don't remember if it is already possible to use Ice Beam TM on Swampert yet, but serebii says it is in Mauville/abandoned ship. Since both of these places are reachable i will consider it is possible, but in any case, I remember I found a Manectric lv 29 right past the surf area east of Mauville. (For my luck it came timid at first). The only problem might be Altaria. I remember Winona sends it early and try to use Dragon Dance, you can just use roar with Manectric. When Altaria is the only left, she is most likely strike with Earthquake, this is where you can switch Manectric with Swampert and it will tank. Next you strike with Ice beam and it is at least 2HKO. In the worst of scenarios Marshtomp learns bide. It can be surprisingly helpful, specifically in a bulky pokemon like Swampert 

Next is Tate and Liza. Most of their pokemons are ground type, Swampert for them. Manectric for Xatu. 

Then it is Wallace or Juan. This with Norman could be a problem because of Kingdra and Whiscash. Mitotic and Sealeo are bulky but nothing that Manectric with Thunderbolt can't deal with. Plus Manectric can deal with Kingdra since it takes x1 damage 

For the Elite 4 Swampert should have Earthquake already

At the worst cases you can blast Ice beam in his grass types. The others won't resist an earthquake. Crawdant and Sharpedo are easily taken down by Manectric 

Phoebe is irrelevant, nothing that Swampert or Manectric can't deal with 

Glacia is just a worsened Juan 

Then for Drake it is really useful to have Ice beam on Swampert 

For Steven, the only problem might be Cradily, all of the other pokemons are taken down with Surf, Earthquake or Thunderbolt

GTA,GTA 3 Paramedic Tips,"Just finished up GTA 3 paramedic after at least 20 serous attempts. Here are my tips:

- As most people already know, do it at the start of the game before the Triads and Mafia are pissed at you. Portland is also pretty easy to navigate but there are a few tricky spots. 

- Drive carefully. The handbrake is necessary. The last thing you want is to reverse over the patient and kill them, or even worse, knock them down and run out of time because it takes them 5 seconds to get back up. Use the handbrake to stop basically every time. Go slow unless you are on a solid straightaway. Keep control. The moment you get cocky is the moment the ambulance tips over.

- Time is arguably the most important element beyond pure driving skill. You have a ‚Äúbank‚Äù of time that you build up each round. You get more time for going further from the hospital, so my advice is to branch out a bit further for your first pickups so you can build your bank.

- Plan your route. After it gets to level four, you must pause, look at the map, and figure out the gameplan. Group your pickups with efficiency,  and keep the bank in mind. It‚Äôs always better to keep moving forward and use the roads to turn around than reversing and doing a k-turn. There are roads in Portland you will learn to love that are easy to cruise down, the big road on the hill with St. Marks Bistro being my favorite. 

- Once again, drive extremely carefully. Don‚Äôt smash into other cars. You will kill the ambulance. Don‚Äôt get a wanted level. If you do, keep calm and carry on, but now you have to be extra careful you don‚Äôt get arrested on a pickup.

- Know that this will be up to chance a lot of the time and it‚Äôs going to take you at least 10 major tries before you accomplish your goal.

Godspeed!",FIFA,pos

FIFA,Why do ‚ÄòTraders‚Äô get so much hate?,"Why do traders get so much hate in the FIFA community - there‚Äôs a common misconception that traders negatively influence or control the market.

Traders probably make up less than 1% of the coins on the market.

Let‚Äôs be clear - EA control the market. They control supply through pack weights and they control demand through their programming of the game and its meta and SBCs.

The fact is at certain points of the game trading is just as fun as playing and the vitriol spouted towards some traders on other threads about people holding 10-15 FUT captain or birthday cards is so far wide of the mark. Those hoarded cards make up a tiny fraction of what‚Äôs out there.

The problem is the content is shite and people who have them in their clubs have probably stopped playing who could sell but also most importantly - EA has made a huge balls up by leaving them out of packs.",FIFA,pos
FinalFantasy,I just beat Final Fantasy for the very first time. Here are my thoughts.,"This is a very solid game. I enjoyed a lot of it and disliked some parts. Let me get to the parts that I disliked first so that I can get to the good stuff after.

It's very hard to know where to go at some points in the game if you're not talking to most NPC's. I remember when I started my first playthrough, it was difficult for me to know where to go next, and that's probably because I've gotten so used to games these days giving me some sort of quest marker, or directly telling me where to go. Seeing how this was the first game in the series, and also taking into account that this was first released on the NES in 1987/1990, I can understand why they couldn't do that. Back in those days, it was probably normal for a player to have to go around talking to every NPC to get all the information you NEEDED to progress. I don't hold it against the game, since it's very much a sign of the times.

Now on to the good stuff. I've heard from different sources that this game is heavily reliant on grinding, but on my most recent playthrough, I never found the need to grind, and that's partially because I was

1. not running from every battle and 2.  going out of my way to open all of the chests.

I think if you go about the game with this mentality, you'll find the game a lot less tedious. HOWEVER, I should preface this by saying that this playthrough was of the Pixel Remaster, and I'm not sure if you're given more EXP than in the original NES version. I am curious to see how the older versions play out with this mentality in mind. Speaking of the NES version, there is one gameplay element in that game that I have a love hate relationship with, and that's the ineffective attacks. On one hand, it's annoying whenever it happens, but on the other hand, it discourages the ""hold a to win"" mentality that plagues the future games in the series, or even the Pixel Remaster. It adds a bit of strategy to the game, and I kind of like it. That out of the way, let me talk about the soundtrack. Another solid from the team. The ""***Opening Theme***"", or the Final Fantasy overture is a series staple, and I literally cannot think of how the future games would me as musically memorable without its inclusion in this game. It's because of this game, and the musical genius Nobuo Uematsu that we have such a track to listen to. Other songs include ""***Prelude***"", or the Crystal Prelude, which is also a series staple. The ***Town*** Theme, the ***Shop*** theme, the ***Airship*** theme, the ***Battle*** theme (who's opening rift has also been somewhat of a series staple), the ***Victory*** theme (so iconic), and of course, the ***End Theme***. I don't have much to say about the story, or the characters, since those elements aren't as prevalent as they are in older games. Garland being the big bad comes out of nowhere, and I feel like the lack of a concrete villain and motive makes the game a bit aimless. Dragon Warrior was an RPG that also came out on the NES, and you knew what you were fighting for in that game: to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord. Getting the four crystals of the elements to light up and defeating the four fiends is fine and all, but why are we doing it? What's our motivation? You could make the argument that it was because of the prophecy of the four warriors of light, and sure I guess, but again, not having a concrete villain hurts it in the long run, at least in my opinion. Again, this is something that I can excuse since this was an NES game, and the focus of the dev team was probably more aimed at the gameplay, which is super solid, rather than the story. But hey, maybe I'm a dumbass and just wasn't able to really see the story for what it was worth.

Overall, I like this game. I'd give it a solid 8/10 and probably put it on the A tier if I made a tier list of all the games. And I can't wait to see what I think of Final Fantasy 2. If I had to guess, I'm probably going to like it a lot. Seeing how it's one of the most divisive games in the series, along with Final Fantasies 8 and 13, those being S teir for me, I'm probably going to like Final Fantasy 2 a lot.",FinalFantasy,neg

GTA,My attempt at connecting GTA and RDR,"As we know GTA and RDR are both exaggerations of the real world (although RDR is a bit more realistic) and have terrible ultra violence so they may as well be in the same universe plus they have little references to each other like the epsilonists and Francis.

‚ÄúWhat about the contradictions‚Äù I hear you hypothetically asking, well I can at least kinda do liberty city, so NYC is mentioned in the RDR games (1899-1914) right before the First World War and in WW1 there was a huge wave of patriotism across the United States so perhaps in this universe it ramped up and went a bit too extreme so they renamed the NYC/NYC state to liberty city/liberty state to be more patriotic and if you‚Äôre gonna say something about the Burroughs and Alderney, they weren‚Äôt mentioned in the RDR games (to my knowledge) so they can suck it.

‚ÄúBut what about California and San Andreas?‚Äù I hear you asking again for some god awful reason (by the way shut the f@ck up), anyways in San Andreas (the game) Las Ventures,San Fierro and Los Santos are present but in HD San Andreas it‚Äôs only Los Santos so maybe the other cities are in California, I know this is a big hypothetical but here‚Äôs the little proof, in GTA 5 you can see a California license plate, in GTA 4 you can hear someone say they have a Californian accent on the radio and in the military base in GTA 5 you can see a map with all the states including California.

In the RDR games jack is shown to have a large literary drive and in GTA 5 you can see a book written by a ‚Äúj Marston‚Äù this couldn‚Äôt have been written by John because ya know being shot will kill you plus he wasn‚Äôt shown to be really that interested in literature thus far so it would make more sense for it to be jacks book.

So that‚Äôs all I can think of to say, if you have any feedback or criticisms it would be nice.

pokemon,List of my legendary hexdecuple -- I can't chose the names!!,"Which list of names gels best together?  Looking for vibes of power, intimidation, slight mystery, and overall, I want them to sound like Pokemon. I'm trying to find a proper theme among the names, so no mixing and matching, please.

First, I'll offer an explanation of the creatures that we're trying to name.

A) A Dubwool formed to the shape of a minotaur. It carries a large club, but this is just for show. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

B) A Tauros with ram horns and a bulky body. It has no tails, but the ferocity in its eyes stays. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

C) A Ceruledge with a single blade, the other hand a chunk of misshapen rock. Though its fires may be put out, the moss and stone adorning it offers the same intimidation. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

D) A thin and elegant Mudsdale with a mane running down to its behind and stilt-like legs that carry it above the ground. When sitting still, it looks just like a statue. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

E) Skarmory takes to the skies armored in masonry. A long tail trails behind it. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

F) Slaking finally stands! Alas, he moves with a sluggish gait, and he is so peaceful that moss grows in abundance on him. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn his body.

G) Wishiwashi grows thin, with slick fur along its body. When it Schools, the swarm is long and lively, with electrical charges arching off of it. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

H) A large reptile resembling Heliolisk with wide claws. Despite its bulk, it scuttles like an insect. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

I) Though it may stand upon stilts, it is undeniably Torkoal. When sitting still, it looks just like a statue. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

J) With a slithering body and a three-pronged mouth, Krookodile lurks beneath the sand. Only its eyes appear above the ground, glowing icy blue. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

K) Though it rampages on feline limbs, it is undeniably Gogoat. Tusks jutt from its jaw and a tail trails behind it. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

L) Copperajah rises from the lake, without trunks nor eyes. A verdant grassland grows upon its back. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

M) Snaking high above in the sky, Scolipede has six great wings. With fluffy fur and pebbly skin, it dives beneath the dunes. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

N) Ursaluna guards an ancient city with intricate stone armor and sharp tusks. When sitting still, it looks just like a statue. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

O) A huge ogre with four arms, two armed with butcher's blades and two open to smash. Surely, this is Machamp, despite its horrific size. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn its body.

P) Bound to the earth, the maiden rises high as if she were a castle. Surely, this is Lopunny, despite the energy she fires from her palms. Hunks of stone with strange inscriptions adorn her body.

ok back to skeledirge, it's the ugliest starter imo and i don't use that term lightly so a lot of these changes are personal changes to make it look less 'ugly' also unlike meow i actually did research this time (by that i mean i googled for 5 mins). anyway on to the changes

* made the fire actually look like fire
* smoothed out the facial features to make it less robotic and more ghostly
* made the face resemble a suger skull with FLAWERS instead of whatever the fuck its supposed to be on its face (i tried my best to make it less cluttered)
* reduced the segments to make it less robotic and gave it a ribrage to make spooper
* it's insides have faint because yes
* gave it a cape to resemble its origin also FLAWERS
* gave it an exposed spine because spoopy
* made the bord more fiery and less ORB

i think it looks more a ghost type now and hope the flowers arent too distracting

Cloud in Crisis Core is not a confident guy and so we wouldnt say that hes the most personable, but hes not nearly the Cloud we see in the beginning of FF7. It comes across as dark in a way that doesnt seem to very well align with the Cloud from Crisis Core. So he isnt himself as we see him early, but its also clearly not coming from Zack who is his biggest influence. We see him basically imprinted with the very being of Zack in many ways, and yet Zack is completely opposite of how Cloud acts. Zack is upbeat and lively.

FinalFantasy,FFXVI Combat Feel,"tl;dr: While I'm still excited for FFXVI, I'm sure the story and music will be epic. But after looking at the early game preview the combat feel looks meh.

Looking at the game preview the action Combat Feel seems lacking. I'm talking about when you hit enemy it doesn't feel like you hit enemy. The enemy seems like only vibrate a little. The sound when you hitting something also lacking.

What good example for this is the FF cousin Kingdom Hearts III (Disclaimer: this doesn't mean I view KHIII has superior combat in every way, I just focused on the combat feel).  When you hit enemy the sound of hit is different for every keyblade. The enemy also actually react to it, they have getting hit animation and also getting knocked back. Some exception of this is boss, that usually can't be stopped when the boss is using skill, but even then, sometimes they have a window to be susceptible to combo and give good 'feedback' on getting hit.

Again, this doesn't mean the combat in FFXVI will certainly be less fun though. I still don't know about the engagement of the combat. KHIII that used by my example for combat feel is basically tap X and Triangle, looks pretty and satisfying but the engagement kind of meh until super boss.",thesims,neg

We know that‚Äôs a load of nonsense.

Submit your complaints directly to Nintendo [here](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Contact/General-Customer-Service/Contact-Us-1106389.html#/contactform).

These big companies tend to have formal processes for relaying information and dealing with complaints. It‚Äôs worth describing the issues you‚Äôve faced and demanding a patch directly to Nintendo.

Edit: Wow. First time posting on r/Pokemon and didn‚Äôt know I was dealing with such cynics. All I was doing was bringing awareness of other avenues rather than staying stuck in this echo chamber.

(Rant),"I find it strange the media has latched onto the trans update but can only assume the reason they‚Äôve caught wind is due to one very famous celebrity whose live-streaming of the game has recently made headlines. 

While the media machine is 99% responsible for the way our (US) society is going and it‚Äôs something I pay little mind to, I did get a bit cringy inside reading that we are people indoctrinated by the ‚Äúwoke leftist agenda‚Äù for the simple reason that it‚Äôs a perfect example of why the media is bullshit content with spreading misinformation and outright lies. 

Those commenting have zero grasp on gameplay and clearly haven‚Äôt touched the pack in years- while some concepts I find daunting (e.g. I really get annoyed having to choose my pronouns for every sim, I feel they should be assigned at creation just like irl and then we are free to make the decision after) but these elements are very cool and our game deserve to be completely free from scrutiny by two-minute band wagoners. 
Where were they when we got to assign these pronouns? Where were they when changing a Sim into a woman we could also allow her to give birth (huge shoutout I love not needing a sperm donor for my lesbiSims!) 

The world and state of society is so exhausting as it is and I don‚Äôt need a fragment of my peace being disrupted. The ‚Äúnews‚Äù can‚Äôt find more interesting things to dominate their feeds when so much more can be reported on and that is the most terrifying of it all.

Garchomp: I couldn't think of the final team member. But same as Staraptor I just love Garchomp.

pokemon,Gen V game recommendation for completing a Full National Dex?,"Hi folks!  


I'm playing through the games to [try and complete a full national dex](https://pokedextracker.com/u/Skyeward/catch-em-all-dex). The other goal of this challenge is to actually play through each of the generations as many will be a first time for me - I've never really been beyond Gen IV. As such, the idea is to play one game per generation and work my way through. So far, I've played Blue, Crystal, Emerald and Platinum.  


The rule of the challenge itself is simply to have caught one of everything. The catch can be in any game, and I don't have to keep it (it's not a Living Dex, that just sounds a little bit too much of a pain...) so evolving or trading is fine to get other species. If I don't catch a Pokemon in the gen it was introduced, catching it in a later game is totally fine.  


With that in mind, which Gen V game or games should I play? I'm asking primarily from the perspective of the rules of my challenge and the availability of Pokemon. From an online search, I think I'm only going to get Zorua and Zoroark in BW2, but am I reading correctly that Thundurus and Tornadus are only going to be gotten from BW? Are there more gen V pokemon available in one over the other? Would Gen I-IV Pokemon being available in BW2 make it a lot slower to catch the new Gen V ones? Are the games different enough that they operate almost like two different gens and I should just divert from my rule and play both?

pokemon,"Why Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky will always be the most emotional video game in my lifetime, and how replaying it has been one of the most intense experiences I've ever had playing a game.","Hey Pokemon players so, I just wanted to share something personal relating to the Pokemon games cause it's been weighing heavy on me. I realize there are limitations to what they really let people post on this subreddit but it would mean a lot to me if this post were allowed, and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it I was in tears just writing this so, hopefully this story touches someones heart &lt;3 This is the story of Me and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky.  


Anyway, so let's go back to summer 2015. I was in love with a woman named Jess whom I'd known since college, and we were both big Pokemon fans. Once we moved in together, we would wake up on days that we had nothing going on (which was quite often haha) and play on our GBA/DS/3DS with the tv in the background for hours before really getting around to doing anything. It was like our daily ritual! It was 1 of the things early on that really connected us, the love of the Pokemon universe.  


So, 1 day I tell Jess I'm about to replay Explorers of Sky for the first time in a few years. I'd only ever played through it completely twice, as it wasn't THAT old of a game. To my surprise, she had never played it! She did play the original on GBA however. So I ended up getting it on my PC to play on the TV so she could watch me play and take turns playing and enjoying the story. Over the next few days, it was amazing to see her reaction to all the cute little things and all the great twists and turns of the plot of Explorers of Sky! I think we played it for about 6 hours a day for a week straight lol. All of the amazing music from the game was probably her favorite part actually. And after we finished, we would still listen to the music through the jukebox occasionally and go back to grind.  


So teleport us to about 5 months later, she went away to see her family but had to stay there due to her father having a serious health issue, and I couldn't be with her for about 3 weeks, including New Years. I had no idea when she was coming back so it was pretty depressing. But when she was gone I did another replay of that game to pass the time, and found myself really sad playing it without her. The music honestly hurt to hear.

  
The next winter,,,, life was good, we had got engaged on Thanksgiving, and 2 days after Christmas we went to get matching tattoos at a friends house. And then someone hit our car. Yeah,,, she died instantly, it obviously was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was alone again on New Years, and all I could think about was the music from Explorers of Sky and it just stung bad. So, the whole reason Im writing about this is because I was always afraid to play this game again. But I finally did it.   


My life is pretty good now, I got clean 15 months ago finally, generally am happy, but, if I was ever gonna fully move on I had to play Explorers of Sky again. I was afraid it would be really depressing but, I found myself crying in a good way, with the parts relating to Grovyle and going to the future and back especially, but most of all with the Steam Caves, and Treeshroud Forest music playing. I never cry, I hadn't since 2021 lol but yeah, this game did it. But I feel like I finally can enjoy what may be the best Pokemon game ever, certainly one of my favorite video games ever made. I feel like she was with me the whole time I was playing it and from now on I'll always be grateful to have this game to go back and feel that connection with her, even if she's not here anymore.",GTA,neg

‚Ä¢ Zawarudoze: ‚ÄúZawarudo‚Äù is not a Jono reference but does involve ‚Äúthe world,‚Äù referencing Great Tusk‚Äôs Ground-typing, as does the -doze part, from ‚Äúbulldoze.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt reference its Fighting-typing though.

‚Ä¢Dolomight: Dolomite is something found in the Earth. ‚ÄúMight‚Äù refers to its strength, so it references its Fighting-typing.

Here‚Äôs a list of Pok√©mon I have with nicknames so that you can get an idea of my nicknaming style:

‚Ä¢BoJack (Mudsdale): Named after BoJack Horseman, not the DBZ villain, because they look similar.

‚Ä¢Iceslash (Alolan Sandslash): Because it‚Äôs not made of sand.

‚Ä¢Icetales (Alolan Ninetales): To differentiate it from my standard Ninetales.

‚Ä¢Electrock (Alolan Golem): ‚ÄúElectric‚Äù + ‚Äúrock.‚Äù Pretty easy.

‚Ä¢Geist (Polteageist): Because Polteageist sounded lame. Same logic behind ‚ÄúRime‚Äù for my Mr. Rime.

‚Ä¢Alowak (Alolan Marowak) and Galmanitan (Galarian Darmanitan): Obvious.

‚Ä¢Slowpoise (Galarian Slowbro): ‚ÄúPoise‚Äù because it poises itself to attack when using Shell Side Arm, also it‚Äôs short for poison. 

‚Ä¢Smarticuno (Gal. Articuno): ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù evokes its Psychic-typing.

‚Ä¢Revoltres: ‚ÄúRevolting‚Äù + ‚ÄúMoltres‚Äù, the former referencing its Dark-typing.

‚Ä¢Zapedurse (formerly Stepdos, Gal. Zapdos): ‚ÄúStep‚Äù referenced its feet, but I didn‚Äôt like this nickname and found myself saying ‚Äúzapedurse‚Äù to myself because I‚Äôm weird, so that became the nickname.

‚Ä¢Beweartrap (Gal. Stunfisk): It‚Äôs a beartrap and Bewear is a Pok√©mon.

‚Ä¢Scamurotten (His. Samurott): ‚ÄúScam‚Äù and ‚Äúrotten‚Äù both reference its Dark-typing.

‚Ä¢Zorrormal (H. Zoroark): ‚ÄúZorro‚Äù (Zoroark‚Äôs partial basis) + ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù referring to its Normal-typing.

‚Ä¢Gottem (H. Decidueye): I‚Äôm proud of myself for this one. I couldn‚Äôt come up with anything at first, but after using Triple Arrows, I kept saying ‚ÄúHa! Got ‚Äòem!‚Äù like how you do when you own someone in a debate, so ‚ÄúGottem‚Äù eventually became the name. It works because of how owned the opponent is while also referencing Decidueye‚Äôs deadly accuracy.

‚Ä¢Brainiary (H. Braviary): ‚ÄúBrain‚Äù differentiates it from my standard Braviary while also referencing its Psychic-typing.

‚Ä¢Fightauros, Wetauros, and Hotauros (Paldean Tauros, all three breeds): All three needed to be differentiated from both each other and my standard Tauros with a word referencing their typings ending in T coming before the ‚ÄúTauros‚Äù part.

‚Ä¢Gatoscuro (Sprigatito): For when it evolves into Meowscarada, a name I don‚Äôt like because it didn‚Äôt continue the pattern. In my headcanon it‚Äôs Sprigatito -&gt; Floragato -&gt; Gatoscuro. ‚ÄúGato‚Äù means ‚Äúcat,‚Äù and ‚Äúoscuro‚Äù means ‚Äúdark,‚Äù so it‚Äôs literally ‚Äúdark cat,‚Äù which is great for its typing.

‚Ä¢Melenaleteo (Flutter Mane): Its name in the Spanish version of the game since I didn‚Äôt like their names being two words (even though I‚Äôm fine with the Tapus‚Ä¶)

‚Ä¢Luniathan (Roaring Moon): ‚ÄúLuna‚Äù + ‚Äúleviathan,‚Äù which references both its types. I‚Äôm proud of myself for this one.

In addition I also had a Hisuian Goodra nicknamed ‚ÄúScrewdra‚Äù (screws are metal) before realizing that name completely sucked. When I realized it was an absolute unit, the perfect name hit me like Truck-kun: Sluggernaut. I also had a Hisuian Avalugg nicknamed ‚ÄúGravelugg‚Äù to better reference its Rock-typing.

From looking at these names, it‚Äôs obvious I want them to sound like actual species names unless I can come up with something that‚Äôs more amusing and/or badass, or is a suitable reference. What do you guys think? Can you help me name my Great Tusk using these parameters?

EDIT: Thanks for your suggestions, guys. I looked into it, and it turns out that elephant tusks are elongated incisors. The ‚Äúinci-‚Äú part of ‚Äúincisor‚Äù lines up perfectly with the ‚Äú-ino-‚Äú part of ‚Äúdinosaur,‚Äù so I‚Äôve decided to go with **Incinosaur**. Thoughts?

Runner-ups include:
‚Ä¢Masterdon (‚Äúmaster‚Äù + ‚Äúmastodon‚Äù)

‚Ä¢Elontusk (short for ‚Äúelongated tusk,‚Äù) but I rejected this as it sounds too similar to Elon Musk, which would be very ironic if I picked that as it‚Äôs a past Pok√©mon.

What do you guys think? Should I reconsider? I haven‚Äôt changed the name yet so there‚Äôs still time to get your thoughts in.",FIFA,pos

assassinscreed,"After watching 'you' on netflix, ive realised how great the potential of social stealth is","In the show, the main character stalks people by blending in to the enviroment around him, and while watching i realised how this is what social stealth has potential to be. The idea of being the assassin stalking your target, assassinating them and then getting away completely unnoticed by blending into the croud has been the main concept of social stealth. The idea of hiding in plain sight. And watching this show made me realise how this could be improved upon and be genuinley amazing.I dont know many ideas of how to make it like that, but i have a few ideas.

My first one would be that to blend in more, you can change what you are wearing to fit the occasion better and blend in more, a bit like the system in liberation where you have different outfits that help with different things. This could add alot more depth to social stealth and add tension to thinking what if you get caught. You would have to carefully pick out what you wear that would best fit where you are, and when you are there, the question of if what you picked helps you blend in well will add tension to the scene. It will make it much more immersive and make alot of sense.

If this level of customisation wouldnt work well, maybe just the choice of 2 different outfit types would help. You could have 2 different types of robes. One like ezios or something, that looks flashy and you should use in other situations. And one like jacobs that blends in well that you should use when in public.

Another thing i think would work but it may not be easy to impliment, is that changing the ai could make it so much better. Making it so the ai is more cautious of their surroundings and they turn around every once in a while and are suspicious, but at the same time dont have them be like valhalla where you can get spotted from 50 meters away and you dont even have time to do anything before the stealth meter fills up and they attack you.

The last idea that i think is more important than the others, is give us more reason to hide and blend in. Add more activities to do while in social stealth to not look conspicuous, and give us a reason to do them instead of just running in, killing them, and going out. Make us have to be slow, watch them, and plan out what we do.

Now these ideas may not work in assassins creed as in 'you' the person doing it is a creept stalker who just watches people, but in assassins creed you are the good guys who are blending in to get to the end goal of assassinating someone, so they are quite different circumstances. Even so, i just wanted to give some ideas on this.

I dont really know what i was getting at here but i thought i should share my thoughts on this.",CallOfDuty,pos

pokemon,Do you ever sometimes feel Pokemon would've looked better if it stayed 2D Pixel Art?,"There's nothing inherently wrong with 3D or anything.  But the problem is, I still don't think GameFreak has properly embraced the extra dimension.  I'll start off by saying the problems that they've been having in 3D.

To begin with, there's this concept of [Uncanny Valley.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)  Ever since Pokemon has been 3D by the mainline games, since X and Y, they've entered this, and never left it.  Here are some examples why.

* **They continue to use the 3D Models in the same manner as they have their 2D sprites in battle, and it doesn't work in 3D**:  In the 2D games, the battlefield was an abstraction.  We don't see how much actual distance there is between the battling mon, they're just attacking on circular disc stages, and our mind is able to fill in the gap of what happens between easier as a result.  When a mon uses Tackle and nudges the air on their circle, we can easily imagine them running across X distance to actually ram into the opponent.  However, in 3D space, this no longer works.  We can see exactly how much physical distance there is between the mon.  So, staying on one side of the battlefield and nudging the air here is one of the examples of the games still being in Uncanny Valley since it went 3D.
* **They haven't filled in the gaps that 3D requires to be filled in with NPCs**:  This is most apparently seen in the remakes of once 2D games, like BDSP.  Characters still behave in a very stiff, unnatural (and thus Uncanny Valley) manner in the 3D space, like walking on a grid, but not moving diagonally, so they only ever do 90 degree turns.  It's entirely possible to have diagonal and smoother movement, while still being on a grid.  Just take a look at RuneScape, or even in 2D games, Lufia:  The Ruins of Lore also has smooth movement on a grid.  Also, when it comes to cutscenes, we still have lots of things being implied to have happened, rather than being shown, which is more awkward in 3D.  For example, rival Barry bumping into the player; in the old 2D Gen 4 games, the characters are very stoic and don't budge an inch.  It was possible to have the player be nudged and shake, or even get pushed back a tile, but it's still easier to accept just a textbox ""THUD!"" in this abstraction.  However, in a 3D space, that same sort of stoic reaction to that situation once again comes across as Uncanny Valley.  The characters don't lose balance, or get knocked over, or anything, so it really does just come across as far too stiff in 3D.
* **The disconnect between characters moving their mouths, but having no voice acting**:  This is made worse when the cameras are up close to their face in the 3D games too, like Sword and Shield's intro being right up in Rose's face as he flails his arms and shouts about, but not a single peep is heard out of him.  Or how Piers is doing a whole concert at his gym, but all we hear are clothes ruffling and foot tapping sounds.  I believe even Black and White 2 had something more than this for Roxie.  With the 2D games, we never saw their mouths moving to begin with, due to how low-res the pixel art was, but even if we did, I think it'd be easier to accept this in 2D rather than 3D.
* **The colours of the characters and mon aren't as vibrant as the 2D sprites**:  This is more apparent if you directly compare the models with their 2D sprite counterparts from the older games.  Charizard is a less vibrant orange and looks washed out, Blastoise is a less vibrant blue, etc.

Now of course, this isn't to say they haven't had some good things in 3D.  Some of the new signature moves, like Cinderace's ability, do get lots of dynamism from the camera moving around and dynamic angles.  But the question ends up being, is it worth it, when everything else suffers.

Next I want to talk about an example of what Pokemon could still be if it stayed 2D.

My thought is, it could've gone higher resolution with the pixel art, and given us more detailed sprites and worlds.  The DS era saw them hybridizing 2D and 3D, with the characters being 2D sprites, and the environments being 3D.   I think that could've kept going, but the pixel art would've needed to go higher resolution, to match the smoothness of the polygons at higher resolutions.  There's an artist on DeviantArt named [SassySnivy](https://www.deviantart.com/speedxaaa), who sometimes does higher-res remakes of the old 2D Pokemon sprites, and it looks gorgeous!  I think it's an example of how Pokemon could've looked, if it stayed 2D Pixel art.  Here are some examples of their work below!

[Pokemon Black\/White Onix, High Resolution](https://preview.redd.it/8jebb2e5g4ma1.png?width=144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f0dfdc72949855eb297d547ea2a73991bd355e36)

pokemon,A Deep Dive into the Origins of Ting-Lu (tl;dr at the end),"This will likely be the first of 4 posts, each detailing the origins of each member of the Treasure of Ruins. Yes, I know this is out of order. No, I don't care because Ting-Lu is my favorite and I will die on this hill.

First up, etymology. Ting-Lu's name is very straightforward, being the Wade-Giles romanization of its Chinese name, ÈºéÈπø. Èºé refers to the cauldron on its head, while Èπø means deer.

Out of the two, the more interesting one is the Cauldron. In ancient China, these cauldrons were originally used for cooking, but later developed into religious vessels of sacrifice and then eventually symbols of imperial authority. The green-ish color indicates that it is likely made up bronze, as most cauldrons were, though interestingly it has a round bottom and 3 legs, as opposed to a square bottom and 4 legs that were used by those of higher authority. One possible explanation is that the cauldron was made very early on, before the invention of the 4-legged cauldrons, when cauldrons were made almost exclusively by nobles and for them to show their power. The age of the cauldron is fitting, as Ting-Lu is the accumulated fear of people over thousands of years, which I will go over later.

Regarding their symbolism, Legend goes that an ancient king once ordered to make 9 massive cauldrons for 9 of its regions to celebrate the kingdom's wealth and engrave the kingdom's wisdom on it for future generations. They were so large that it took millions of people months to move them to the capital city once they were built. Over the years, as kingdoms were overthrown and capitals moved from place to place, the new kings would move the cauldrons with them, symbolizing the seize of political power. A person asking about the quality of the cauldrons were a direct indication that they would want to seize power. All 9 cauldrons were eventually lost.

Now that we understand the cauldron, why deer? My favorite answer is that this is a massive reference to the book *The Deer and the Cauldron* by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). Jin Yong was one of the most influential  writers in Chinese history who wrote almost exclusively in the Wuxia genre, which is mixture between historical fiction, fantasy, drama, and lots of martial arts. His books are characterized by rich references to traditional Chinese culture and values, combining factual history with mystical powers that roughly follow Chinese philosophy. *The Deer and the Cauldron* is his last Wuxia novel, and is the most unique of them all; instead of a traditional hero, the protagonist is a lazy and rebellious anti-hero with no knowledge of martial arts, akin to the Dark type in Pokemon. During his journey, he made friends with the ‚ÄúHeaven and Earth society‚Äù, a secret society aiming to overthrow the Qing dynasty and became their spy in the palace. Through wit, deception, and sheer luck, he became a powerful figure in the government known as the ‚ÄúDuke of Deer Cauldron‚Äù, assisting both the emperor and his underground friends. However, the emperor eventually found out about his falsity, and forced him to either remain loyal to the palace and kill the society, or be exiled and outcast forever. He chose the latter, bringing his entire wealth and 7 wives to a remote land in the South, never to be found again.

How does this relate to Ting-Lu? In the story, the cauldron symbolizes a king‚Äôs desire to seize absolute authority, while the deer symbolizes the common people helplessness to fight back. Together, they represent the struggles of Chinese (Han) people against the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. This coincides with how the cauldron in Ting-Lu is broken: the ancient Chinese rituals are replaced with foreign ones, breaking the traditional norms. It also explains the dex entries. In Scarlet, Ting-Lu is revealed to be the embodiment of fear, alluding to how Ancient Chinese history is one of many dynasties, each one ending violently either by a tyrant or an invader, each time bringing along great chaos that causes mass fear and panic. For Violet, Ting-Lu bringing its head to the ground can be seen as a metaphor for a dynasty crumbling, splitting the country into dozens of fragments just as how Ting-Lu splits the earth. Ting-Lu is the embodiment of the common people's fear of the upper-class authority of the government.

Finally, let's take a look at how the rest of this Pokemon supports my theory. Ting-Lu's ability, Vessel of Ruin, lowers special attack, just as how the iron grip of a strong authority restricts minds and willpower. The Dark type is self-evident, while the Ground type likely refers to land and the importance of land in political control. In Ancient Chinese philosophy, people reside on the ground and the gods reside in heaven (literally 'sky'). Control over land is direct control over political power, especially since Ancient China was very much an agricultural society, where people lived in farms and rarely moved beyond. Land is the people's home, and thus changes in Land, either politically or physically, results in massive fear of the unknown future as people could no longer sustain themselves with what was passed on by their elders. The emphasis on 'homeland' is a large part of Chinese values, as is patriotism. Another interpretation is that Ground is ancient and steady, like the rule of a powerful authority. This can be seen on Ting-Lu's body, where clear layers can be seen like those of mountains or sedimentary rock, even building up a mountain at the top. These layers can only be formed over long periods of time, where different climates creates different layers that build up on top of one another. Ting-Lu's chin also has what looks like to be stalactites, which can also only be formed over long periods of time. 

TL;DR: Ting-Lu references a famous novel of the Wuxia genre, where the cauldron and the deer symbolize the greed for power and the commoners' fear and helplessness in face of violence and chaos caused by those with authority.",pokemon,pos

GTA,I had ChatGPT write a Hypothetical GTA movie:,"Title: ""Grand Theft Auto: Phallis Heat""

The movie opens with Eduardo Riviera (played by Oscar Isaac) breaking into a luxurious mansion in the wealthy suburbs of Phallis. As he sneaks around the darkened rooms, he comes across Malcolm Roberts (played by Michael B. Jordan), a corrupt agent of the National Office of Security Enforcement (NOOSE), who is conducting an illegal operation.

Despite the initial tension between them, Eduardo and Malcolm soon realize that they have a common goal ‚Äì to make a fortune in the criminal underworld of Phallis. Eduardo, a young and ambitious street thief, is eager to make it big, while Malcolm, a seasoned law enforcement agent, is willing to bend the rules to achieve his own personal gain.

As they team up, Eduardo and Malcolm engage in a series of daring heists and violent confrontations with rival gangs, corrupt officials, and other dangerous characters in the seedy underbelly of Phallis. They quickly become known as the most notorious and feared criminals in the city, attracting the attention of both the police and the criminal organizations they are working against.

However, things take a turn for the worse when NOOSE discovers Malcolm's involvement in a series of high-profile robberies. Malcolm is captured and taken into custody, leaving Eduardo to fend for himself. Refusing to abandon his partner, Eduardo puts his own life on the line to break Malcolm out of jail.

As they flee through the streets of Phallis, pursued by both the police and rival criminal organizations, Eduardo and Malcolm must work together to stay alive and clear their names. The once-unbreakable bond between the two men is tested as they face insurmountable odds and betrayal from unexpected sources.

As they close in on the mastermind behind the robberies, Eduardo and Malcolm must choose between their personal gain and their loyalty to each other. In a final showdown, they confront the true enemy of Phallis, a powerful crime lord who will stop at nothing to eliminate them both.

In the end, Eduardo and Malcolm emerge victorious, having survived the ultimate test of their partnership. As they part ways, they both realize the true cost of their actions and the importance of their friendship. ""GTA: Phallis Heat"" is a thrilling crime drama that explores the complex relationships between law enforcement and criminal activity and the lengths people will go to for their own gain. With outstanding performances by Oscar Isaac and Michael B. Jordan, this movie will keep audiences on the edge of their seats from beginning to end.

(Note: I did not cast Michael and Oscar for the roles, the ai kind of made that part up for some reason pretty cool though.)

pokemon,How often is Charizard actually used?,"I saw a dumb ""Charizard is overrated"" meme recently. I like Charizard a lot, but I do agree with the sentiment that it is an overused Pokemon... Or did I? I thought about how often Charizard is used in the core series games and typed them into a long winded comment on that post, but then I thought people might want to know this, maybe, probably. Anyways, here's the comment:

I know that no one cares about this post, because it's pretty stupid, but I'm going to use this as an opportunity to think about how frequently Charizard is used or can be caught in each main series game

RGB: Charmander is one of the three starter Pokemon of the Kanto Region, and Charizard is prominently on the box art of Pokemon Red.

Y: A Charmander can be obtained from an NPC on route 24, who claims he's not a good enough trainer to raise it

GSC: A Charizard is featured in the opening movie of GS using a powerful fire type move. A few trainers in the game use members of the Charizard Evolutionary Family, Including Lance and Red, however Charmander nor it's evolutions are obtainable without trading.

RSE: Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable without trading

FRLG: Charmander is one of the three starter Pokemon of the Kanto Region, and Charizard is prominently on the box art of Pokemon FireRed

DPPt: Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable without trading

HGSS: A few trainers in the game use members of the Charizard Evolutionary Family, Including Lance and Red. After defeating Red, the player can get a Charmander from Professor Oak as a choice between the 3 Kanto starters.

BW: Because of the nature of the Unova games, being somewhat of a reboot of the series, Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable without trading

B2W2: Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable without trading

XY: Professor Sycamore battles the player character with all three Kanto starters, including Charmander, and then allows the player to choose between one of them. If the player chooses Charmander, Sycamore will also give the player a Charizardite that matches the game. Charizard receives 2 Mega Evolutions: Mega Charizard X is a Fire/Dragon type that is more Physically powerful, while Mega Charizard Y retains the Fire/Flying type and is more Specially powerful. Later in the game, the Professor will battle you again with fully evolved Kanto starters, including Charizard.

ORAS: Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable without trading

SM: Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable without trading. However, the Ride Pager can register a Charizard to fly you across the Alola Region

USUM: Charmander can be found in Route 3 using the Island Scan feature. The Ride Pager can register a Charizard to fly you across the Alola Region

LGPE: Similarly to Pokemon Yellow, Charmander can be obtained from an NPC on route 24, who claims he's not a good enough trainer to raise it. However, he firsts tasks the player with catching a total of 50 Pokemon. Lance will now use a Charizard on his team, like in the Johto games, and he will Mega Evolve it into Mega Charizard X in his rematch. Blue uses a Charizard on his team, as it was his starter Pokemon. He will Mega Evolve it into Mega Charizard Y when challenging him in the Viridian Gym.

SwSh: Charizard is Champion Leon's signature Pokemon, and frequently strikes a pose he calls his ""Charizard Pose."" The Player can strike the Charizard Pose by spinning for a while. Charizard receives a Gigantamax form with the Max Move G-Max Wildfire. Charmander and it's evolutions can be found in Dynamax Raids throughout the Wild Area. In the Post Game, Leon will give the Player a Charmander capable of Gigantamaxing.

SwSh Expansion Pass: Members of Charmander's Evolutionary Family can be found in the Dynamax Adventures in the Crown Tundra.

BDSP: Charmander can be found in the Grand Underground in areas where Fire Type Pokemon frequently appear.

PLA: Charmander and it's evolutions are not obtainable

SV: While Charmander and it's evolutions are normally not obtainable without trading, A special 7-Star raid event called ""Charizard The Unrivaled"" allows the player to catch a Charizard from 7-Star event raid dens
_____________________________________________________

So, what does this tell us? It seems that Charizard started being used more frequently starting with XY, which is about where the overused claims started popping up, I think anyway. The most prominent it was used in prior to that were the Gen 1 and 2 games, which makes sense. While I don't personally care about what Gamefreak does with Charizard, since I'm still a Charizard fan, I can see why fans are getting annoyed by how frequently Charizard is put in the spotlight nowadays.

assassinscreed,Something that bothered me in Origins [potential spoiler for Origins],"I‚Äôm way behind on the AC franchise but have gotten into playing through some of the older games. I finished Origins and loved it, but there‚Äôs one group of side quests that I am not a fan of. Bayek, who I think is a great character, fighting in the gladiator arena feels completely inconsistent with his character to me. For the part of the storyline where he fights in the arena it makes sense, because he does it both to help his friend and as a means to an end in finding someone to get revenge on. But when the side quests are introduced where you can go to the arena and he is fighting essentially as a normal (free) gladiator for money, it seems completely wrong for his character. He isn‚Äôt really motivated by money or glory throughout the story, and fights for freedom and for the protection of his people. It seems like he should be ideologically opposed to killing people in an arena, especially given that most gladiators were enslaved as the game acknowledges.

I know that realistically the reason the gladiator arenas were part of the game is that they made this arena setting and boss battle mode and wanted to use them, and I know I am nitpicking but it was just something that I didn‚Äôt like as part of the canon. Did anyone else think this part felt a little wrong? Am I being picky? Do you disagree and think gladiator fights are in line with Bayek‚Äôs character? Curious to hear what people think.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Which Generation of games do you wish you had grown up with?,"Modern Pokemon games are great, but nothing beats the excitement of playing Pokemon with your friends at school in the era that those games first came out. I grew up in the Gen 1-3 era, but didn't start playing until Gen 2 (Gold). I bought Red afterwards since it was still being sold in stores at the time, but nobody was really playing Gen 1 anymore at that time so I didn't get to enjoy it to the fullest extent (though was able to trade some Gen 1 Pokemon to Gold). Gens 2 and 3 however are a different story. They were the newest and most popular games at the time and EVERYONE was playing them. You could trade and battle with friends, spread playground rumors and utilize all of the options available in the games that aren't really available in emulators today, such as Mystery Gift, mixing records in RSE, the Union Rooms in FRLG, E-reader cards to get specific key items, Action Replays/GameSharks and ToysRus giveaways. 

I feel I was lucky to fully experience those games at that time and glad I grew up with those games. Emulators and ROMs are great, but it's hard to fully emulate the experience you had playing those games when they first came out. Likewise some people may have preferred to grow up with later gens to fully experience playing with friends at that time, because when I was in middle school and highschool and the DS games were coming out, not as many people my age were playing anymore so it was a much more solo experience for me, whereas it wouldn't have been if they came out when I was in elementary school. Which era would you have preferred to grow up in?

FIFA,Why does Rivals Co-Op increase your teammate's rivals wins/division?,"Not sure if its always been like this or not.

My friend picked up the game whilst it's on sale. We've been playing with his gold squad in rivals and I noticed my division and wins going up. Has it always been like this? Seems insane that I'm now pushed in division 1 even though my non-meta team (and bad skills) will not be able to compete in division 1. Basically means I can't play with my friend if I ever want to play my own squad in rivals. Fortunately it has increased my wins though, so I'm getting the max rewards this week. But that is easily exploitable.

It's pretty mad that in a game like Fifa, based on a sport you play with your friends, that co-op is barely thought about. I also noticed that you can't co-op on drafts but you can on console if you're both on the same console.

Also not to derail this but I wish there was a WL that was co-op only. It would make the grind so much easier.",FIFA,pos

FinalFantasy,Thoughts on FF6,"Hi there, this is my first post in reddit and i wanted to share my opinions on this great game FF6.
I think this one is a fun game, but when i finished it a few days ago on GBA emulator (for the first time), i thought it would be better because many people have it on the top of the series. Then i did a little research and found that in the early 90s there was no JRPG like FF6. So looking the game with the lens of the past, its a close perfect game. 
Anyways, i still think that is below FF7 and FF10. Thats because when im playing i dont care about  how was the game in the past but how much fun i get playing the game. 
I mean, i dont think FF6 has a good character development as other (newer) games on the franchise (like many people says). Yes, in its era it had a great character development, but now is kinda meh. And it makes sense for a LOT of reasons.
With this post, i just wanted to say that when we talk about games (good or bad opinions), we have to do it specifying the context i guess.
By the way, i loved the characters. Kefka is fucking awesome. Celes is the real main character for me (like Ashe in FFXII). Edgar and Sabin are great in WoB, and i think Shadow, Gau, Mog and Relm are great in WoR. 
But thats it, i enjoyed the game, but not as much as i expected.
Thanks for reading (sorry for my english i guess, im argentinian)",legostarwars,pos

assassinscreed,Update: my dad loved AC: Origins Discovery Tour!,"A little under two weeks ago, I asked about whether Assassin's Creed would be doable for my father who's never gamed before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/10gxk5l/would\_ac\_be\_a\_doable\_game\_for\_a\_60\_year\_old\_who/](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/10gxk5l/would_ac_be_a_doable_game_for_a_60_year_old_who/)

He came over on Sunday and tried Assassin's Creed: Origins Discovery Tour and loved it! He quickly got the hang of moving around with the left joystick. Controlling the camera with the right was more difficult, though. But he hadn't seen video games since I played Tintin: Destination Adventure (a game for PS1, from 1996) in the late 90s. Needless to say, he was blown away by the graphics and details. A fun detail he mentioned was that a lot of the dialogue in Alexandria is in Ancient Greek. He also enjoyed slamming into NPC's, then watching them stumble and curse at him. He literally went out of his way to hit them and giggled like a child when doing so. 

He would like to finish the discovery tour and play the other ones. He expressed regret that there isn't one for Unity, Syndicate, or AC: III. He also wants to try the games. So, mission accomplished, I guess!",pokemon,pos

pokemon,Im convinced yall dont know what spin off means,"I swear whenever I go to a post about PLA theres a bunch of yall saying its just a spinoff. Mostly becauze of the catching, zones, and not having online battles. I find it extremely troubling that gamefreak trying to make a drastic change with their game mechanics instead of sticking to what they know is seen as just a side project instead of indicative of their vision for the future. Like it feels like yall complain about them not changing anything, but when they do you hate on it or say they should go back to how it was before. Like Sinnoh fans are complaining about their remake, but their region literally also got PLA which is the biggest love letter to their games they could get.

Also, its literally a prequel, is made by the same developer, still has turn based battle, you still play as a trainer who picks from 3 starters, gamefreak themselves said it was mainline, it was HEAVILY advertised on the pokemon website, has regional forms and evos, etc.

Like imagine if people called Mario Odyssey a spin off because of the Zones and cappy being drastically different from the usual gameplay.

Mario Kart is a spin off, Mario Sonic Olympics is a spinoff, Pokemon snap is a spin off, Paper mario is a spin off, Pokenn is a spinoff, but PLA is not.",CallOfDuty,pos

assassinscreed,I just completed rogue for the first time and have mixed feelings,"I came into this expecting it to be more of a copy paste of AC4 with a templar theme, and more of a spinoff than full game. Although i was right, man this game is way too short. Im talking around 8hrs for me.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole premise of assassin turned templar is a very compelling one, and this really could have been a rich deep story instead of the short , underdeveloped story that it is. We don't spend enough time to watch and experience Shay's story as a templar enough, and their were way too many time skips for me to even care about the characters on the assassins or templars aside from colonel monroe, and it was cool being on Hytham's side.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that really bugged me was the complete 180 they did to the assassins in this game. From Ac1 to revelations the assassins were mostly good, but not exactly perfect and the templars were over the top full blown evil with no redeeming qualities doing the most despicable deeds than laughably claiming ""they are doing it for the greater good"". The brotherhood in this game are the absolute worst in the franchise corrupt, power hungry, and careless towards innocent people.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i understand not all brotherhoods are good, and rogue is more of a neither side is good or evil kind of thing with complicated morality, however it's obvious that they watered down the true controlling, corrupt nature of the templars just to make them more enjoyable to side with.

&amp;#x200B;

Shay as a character is honestly just..... ok. If he wasn't a templar he would be very forgettable honestly, but he is more likable than Arno, and genuinely has a good heart and wants to protect innocent people, feeling he is doing the right thing joining the templars, and in the case of this game he is. The only memorable things is his hilarious irish accent, and ""I make my own luck"" 1 liner. That ending of him being the murderer of Arno's father is pretty cool and probably the best example of connectivity i have seen in the franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to everything else from combat to the world if you like AC4 you will like this one. Overall definitely my least favorite, but had potential of being my favorite if they put more love and care into it.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Arceus theory (combining inputs from some of you),"Some of you get a bit offended when someone says Arceus is too weak to be called a God. Some suggested that the Pokemon #493 that you catch in the games is a *portion* of Arceus and not the real deal. So here's a theory:
What if there indeed was a God pokemon that created the pokeverse, but the effort and energy needed to pull off that feat led to it being fragmented into many Arceuses (maybe 100s), similar to how fission happens in micro organisms. Now, each Arceus is no longer all-powerful, and is just *one of the* stronger Pokemon. That explains him not having any planet level feats in the entire anime/games.

pokemon,Frosmoth Appreciation Post,"I just completed Violet and I've gotta say I may have a new favorite Pokemon. My very first tera raid was a Snom, which was exciting to me because I've always liked ice types but hardly ever see them until late game when I already have a team I like. It also had an electric tera type which I'm sure isn't optimal but the light bulb is cute and it at least helped with the bug/ice weaknesses in a pinch.

I kept that Snom until it became a Frosmoth, which I don't think I've ever even used before. I absolutely love it's cry, I live in a part of the world that gets a lot of snow and it just reminds me of walking outside in the morning and seeing the sunrise make the whole world sparkle. Mine isn't shiny but I think it has a particularly beautiful shiny coloring as well!

I kept this Frosmoth all the way through the game, it felt more like my starter Pokemon than my weed cat - whenever I ran into trouble my Frosmoth bailed me out. I just know I'll end up leveling it to 100 and eventually breeding until I get a shiny friend for it.

Coming from an old person who started on Red version on my GameBoy color, I've never been more surprised and enamored with a Pokemon until this one!!!",FIFA,pos

pokemon,signature moves concept for iron valiant and roaring moon,"I wish roaring moon and iron valiant get thier own moves, i got two names while thinking about it

For roaring moon 
Cresent Night
100bp dark move
taunts target


For iron valiant
Chromatic Blades
25bp fairy move
Hits three times with more damage each hit
Uses strongest offensive stat




Explanation: 

-for roaring moon idk it just seems like it likes taunting others, like how dinosaur are shown to like roaring a lot before or after winning a fight in media, the name is just, idk it sounds cool, 

-for iron valiant, the whole thing reminds me of Little Battler eXperience, i thought it will be cool if iron valiant would attack by cambos, two slashes and a blade stab to be exact, iron valiant is viable both physically and specially, so it's a waste to have a move it uses only 50% of the time",CallOfDuty,pos

assassinscreed,Assassin‚Äôs Creed - Vigil of the Hidden Ones: Chapter 2," I motion with a nod for the others to follow my lead, as I leap off the bureau and into the darkness. I land in a stream surrounded by tall grass. The cold water seeps into my sandals and splashes on my ankles. The others follow closely behind; Aelius to my right rolling on the ground with a noticeable splash, Bennu to my left with the light pounce of a Mau cat, and behind me Adio lands with swiftness, causing a light splash. The four of us head to the fort, gliding through stalks of grass silently to prevent witnesses. I smile to myself as with each step, the others adjust themselves to become increasingly undetected. We arrive under the base of the fort, still hidden by tall grass and murky water. The Roman fort is a massive cubicle held up by four white marble walls, however with cracks and holes easy for climbing.. Large Roman flags stand proudly by each entrance, which are each guarded by two soldiers. Many archers stand atop the fort, easily visible with their torches, pacing back and forth along the border. I raise my hand for the other to stop. ‚ÄúThere is a catch to this mission, I will not be helping you tonight‚Äù. This response is met with surprise from the recruits, so I continue. ‚ÄúHidden Ones must know how to work together to ensure our survival, even in unexpected situations. I trust in all of your abilities, so now you three must trust one another.‚Äù The three of them turn to look at one another, gauging what each of them are capable of. Finally Aelius speaks up, ‚ÄúWith my knowledge of Roman tactics and military experience, I believe I should lead this operation ‚Äù. Adio steps towards Aelius, making no effort to hide his disapproval, ‚ÄúYou may know how those neket iadet fight, but can you forget you were one of them when we get inside; Roman? ‚Äù. Aelius and Adio stare each other down with hostility, but before I could say anything Bennu intervened. ‚ÄúBoys this isn‚Äôt the time for this, the Mentor wants us to work together! I‚Äôll lay down traps around the entrances and position myself on the roof to provide cover. You two are more proficient in close quarters, so figure it out‚Äù. Bennu nods to me, and climbs up the side of the fort with haste, stopping at a ledge beneath a Roman archer. She flicks her left wrist to release her hidden blade, and plunges it into the calf of the guard, and pulls him over the ledge before he can cry out; sending him flailing to his death below. The two of them watch her disappear over the roof, and turn to one another. Adio inhales sharply, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll head in through the sewage system and take out the guards myself‚Äù. Aelius puts his hands on his hips, ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll secure any food and supplies within the compound, I know my way around Roman strongholds''. He turns to me, ‚ÄúMentor, I know you can‚Äôt help us, but could you prepare a cargo horse for the supplies? They should be opposite to the docks'. I smile and chuckle lightly, amused at the sudden cooperation among these two following Bennu‚Äôs scolding. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôll see to that much. The rest is up to you‚Äù.",pokemon,neg

I'm sure that most of us -me included- have had hassles regarding that we could only get ONE of two selectable fossils per game, per account, but I'm honestly surprised that none of the Fossil Pok√©mon appear in Scarlet/Violet. The developers must have understood this, but it would have been better if there was another way to get them, even when Violet focuses on the future more than the past.

Though I could also think... are the Paradox Pok√©mon, particularly the Past Paradox, a *replacement* of the Fossil Pok√©mon?  
There's no limiting to think that the Fossil Pok√©mon *might* return in DLC should it get announced and happen, but I feel like they have from the best designs in the franchise (I mean, who doesn't like dinosaurs?) and need to return.

legostarwars,"I got tired of waiting for LEGO to release an updated Home One set, so I decided to modernize 7754 myself.","I recycled a number of distinct parts, such as the overhead dish projectors all around the room &amp; some basic design elements. I happened to notice that the tile plates that come with the 10497 looked really good, in regards to a generic Mon Calamari cruiser, so I decided I would use a few of those in the layout.

The element I am most proud of is the table - it is designed to collaborate with items from the ‚ÄúPlanet‚Äù series of sets (such as 9676 or 9679 or 75007, etc.), which have studs at the top and bottom. Placing on clear plates-with-longbars can allow for placement of orbiting things, such as the Death Star or a small micro scale fleet. It has a built in turntable component, which I am looking to finish by hooking up to a simple crank.

I kept to the original intent of having 3 separate layers + the catwalks where people/pilots would congregate. I tried to make a number of simple-but-feasible functions along the walls, even though it would normally be basic functions &amp; buttons - the way I have designed this is in a ‚Äúgreeble-it-yourself‚Äù format, where the walls are essentially blank &amp; it can be left to you the designer to throw whatever you would want up there. The hallways below the bridge don‚Äôt have much of anywhere to go, but could be added onto if desired - the main purpose of doing this ship for me was to have a good working model for ‚ÄúRogue Squadron‚Äù content, as a number of their missions ran beyond the three movies.

The hallways on the right side will eventually lead out to the hanger floor, which should have a very large representation of ships &amp; maintenance work going on throughout. I started a machinist/mechanics area at the top, which will eventually have working lifts &amp; the sort. I will likely create a storage area beneath the platform, or some other functional element.",pokemon,pos

Today, I had to throw the towel in on Valhalla just shy of halfway despite really enjoying Eivor. The world and grind was just too great.

Who has time to play and explore all of this? Although beautiful, it's so repetitive and the stories are mediocre and confusing compared to linear games like Mass Effect. I feel far too many games have become this way. Giant big open worlds full of beauty but ultimately empty. I can't get myself to care.

I‚Äôm curious to know if any of the names names on this list ring true for you‚Äîor if you‚Äôve given her a first name in your own head canon (feel free to share in the comments).

My vote is for **Mauve**.  A female given name that means ‚Äúviolet-colored‚Äù.  Not only does *Mauve* have a ‚Äúmaternal‚Äù ring to it and complement the naming scheme established within her family (her son, after all, is named for a primary color), it‚Äôs also a nice nod the purple hue of the character‚Äôs hair.

A few of the other names that would have fit Red‚Äôs mother perfectly had to be excluded due to their prominence in the existing canon‚Äîe.g. *Violet* (Misty‚Äôs older sister) and *Iris* (Opelucid City‚Äôs Gym Leader).

Looking forward to seeing the results!

pokemon,"Ash Ketchum, a tale of disappointment","So with Ash finally retiring after so many years I have some feelings I want to get off my chest and I've finally worked up the courage to make a post about them so here goes.

A little backstory on me, I was born in '98 and I've been watching Pokemon religiously since before I could even form memories. I was always a huge fan, I got bullied for it pretty relentlessly all through grade school but that's another story. My point is I was a super fan, I had the games, the merch, everything, Pokemon was my life as a kid. 

Now when I was a kid I was pretty bad at games, Pokemon being no exception. Sure I knew the type chart and I could make it to the elite four but I regularly skipped trainer battles and I never used items so they would usually wall me out. And watching the anime, seeing Ash make it pretty much as far as I did and fail often made me feel better about my own shortcomings in that department. 

And just like Ash did, I kept trying. Cut to Diamond and Pearl, I was a little late to the party getting a DS not getting one until the DS Lite was out. And I still kinda sucked at it, but by the time Platinum came out I finally got my act together and I managed to beat the game without any outside help. Now that may sound like it took forever but I'm not sure you understand how bad I was at games back then, I usually had to get somebody to trade me a high level mon to sweep for me. 

Now to this point I was still watching the anime, all the time. And Sinnoh was a really intense journey sometimes. Paul felt like Ash's first rival that was an actual bully not just a cocky jerk like Gary. Seeing his Chimchar go through that whole Arc of being with Paul and getting released and dealing with being abandoned was really emotional. Only for Chimchar to evolve to Infernape and be one of Ash's powerhouses on his Sinnoh team. Ash's team felt stronger in general this time around, many of his Pokemon were fully evolved and very strong in their own right. The ending of Sinnoh was possibly going to be the time where Ash finally wins, just like I did.

Cut to Sinnoh League Victors, the final season of Sinnoh. This was the first time the anime had a 4th season because Sinnoh went on forever. And they really hyped this one up. Ash brought back all his Pokemon to visit and help him out in the league and it was so cool seeing all these Pokemon I had met and loved over the years come back to help him together. I'm aware he's done this before with his Pokemon but this was the first time he'd brought all of them together for an event of this magnitude. 

And the battles were INTENSE! He had so many rivals in the Sinnoh League to deal with and his final fight with Paul you really weren't sure who was going to come out on top. This was his last major obstacle in the League, Paul had been a thorn in his side for 4 seasons and several years, would he be able to do it? 

And he did it, he won, he beat Paul, there was nobody else standing in his way, he would finally get to win a Pokemon League. Of course he would've been able to, if it hadn't been for......... Tobias.

Tobias is what people refer to as a ""Ringer"" somebody sent in to ensure that a certain person or persons don't win an event or competition. This man showed up to the Sinnoh League with a Darkrai. A goddamn Darkrai. And in the background of all of Ash's triumphs he was lurking, soloing entire teams of 6 with only his Darkrai. And in the Semifinals of the Sinnoh League he was matched up against Ash.

And Ash got FLATTENED. Darkrai took down 3 of Ash's Pokemon before going down and then Tobias sends out a LATIOS! Then Latios proceeds to clean up the rest of Ash's team, tying with Pikachu for the knockout. 

Just like that, all these years, all this effort, gone. One man and two legendary Pokemon prevented Ash from claiming the title. Tobias moved on to the finals where a completely random person got soloed by Darkrai and Tobias won.

I was devastated, I'd been following Ash's journey for so many years and it felt like I was growing alongside him, and to see him try so hard only to be denied in such an unsatisfying way? It felt unfair. 

Cut finally to Black and White, I was excited. I was actively on the internet now as a teen, new school, new experiences, new Pokemon game. And I got Pokemon Black at launch and it felt so good to start fresh in a new region without running into Magikarp and Zubat everywhere. 

When the anime started airing for BW I was apprehensive considering the heartbreak I had just experienced but I watched it anyway. And I saw Ash's Pikachu get taken out by a brand new trainer, with his brand new starter Pokemon. Trip and his Snivy, basically just Paul with green hair. And yeah I know that Pikachu had just gotten struck by Zekrom's lightning and couldn't use his electric moves but still! His Pikachu should be level 100! One iron tail shouldve destroyed Snivy! 

It was at this point that I felt like they were never going to let Ash win, and if he wasn't going to grow anymore then what was the point in watching, so I stopped I think just after Ash beat Lenora.

Over the years I would still check in on Ash from time to time, seeing what Pokemon he had caught, what place he had made it to in the League, stuff like that. And then in Kalos people were really starting to get hyped again, he had his own personally named after him Greninja form, how could he lose? 

Well we know the answer to that question. I dont even remember the guys name but he used a Mega Charizard X. It was a much closer fight than Tobias I'll grant that but he still lost. And a whole new group of people were disappointed in Ash like I had been years ago.

So when I heard he had won the Alola league? I didn't care, it felt like his last chance to impress anybody was in Kalos and I had given up long ago. But I was hopeful that since he had finally won a League maybe they would move on to a new protagonist. (I personally think they shouldve used the games protagonists as the new protags for every new region in the anime like the manga did but that's another story) and it seemed like they were kind of going in that direction with Goh. It was just the two of them and Goh was doing some impressive things. It felt like they were trying to slowly pass the torch from Ash to Goh.

Then the Masters tourney started, and this is where I had enough of this. Ash goes on to defeat plenty of opponents so on and so forth whatever. But in the semi-finals he goes up against Cynthia, a character who if I was ranking strongest trainers in Pokemon would be near the very top. And he beats her? Ash Ketchum, the kid who lost 6 straight Leagues in a row beat the Champion of the region where he disappointed me so many years earlier. 

I knew he was going to beat Leon, everybody did, they'd been talking about their rematch forever because Leon is super strong or whatever. But when I fought Leon I just Dynamaxed my Inteleon and sweeped his entire team with just that. He was one of the weakest champions I had ever fought. And you're telling me that he beat Ash, who then beat Cynthia? The champion with TWO pieces of theme music accompanying her, the champion whose Piano struck fear into the hearts of trainers everywhere, and she lost.

So now that Ash is getting his heartfelt sendoff as we move on to greener pastures, the only thought on my mind is: Good Riddance. 

I was done with Ash ages ago, and to me this farewell doesn't feel emotional, or sad, or bittersweet. It feels like a relief, like maybe finally I can enjoy the Pokemon Anime again with new characters, never knowing who or what is around each corner. And I'm excited for that, I just felt like I needed to get these feelings off my chest. I'll probably get flamed for this but it was just my experience and I wanted to share it with some people who've maybe had similar experiences and stories. 

In summation, I look forward to a new and brighter future with Pokemon and I hope you all are too.",pokemon,pos

I wish I could still had that file somewhere but now it makes me laugh that the game left on me such impact that I had to learn how to rip scenes from YouTube and stitch them together trying to form a narrative.

pokemon,The many origins of Shiinotic: An overly long analysis of the most underappreciated Alolan Pok√©mon (tl;dr at the end),"Though some may find it forgettable, Shiinotic is my favorite Pok√©mon of all time, and I'm about to go over all the reasons why through a Reddit post of excruciating length. Alas, Shiinotic is not a very popular Pok√©mon, and it's easy to see why: a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like, especially compared to Morelull, most of its inspirations aren't immediately obvious, it's never been featured prominently in any of the games, and even in its first appearance it was horribly overshadowed by nearly every other new Grass- and Fairy-type Pok√©mon. To my knowledge, not one person has ever cared enough about this freaky mushroom-man to write a thorough analysis of its design, its relevance to the Alola region and just why it has the Fairy type... until today.

**Part 1: Mycological Roots**

First, let's take a moment to talk about its heart-meltingly adorable pre-evolution Morelull, an empty-eyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name comes from ""morel"", a famous type of edible fungus, and ""lull"", referring to how its spores can induce sleep; hopefully you haven't been pronouncing it as ""More-lull"". While Morelull may sound innocuous, merely feeding on nutrients from tree roots and soil to sustain itself and never staying in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it needs to, it has potential to be as deadly as any Fairy Pok√©mon: the Japanese Sun and Moon website speaks of an incident wherein a Morelull colony's spores flew into the vents of an airplane that was flying overhead, putting those on board to sleep and nearly causing a crash!

Shiinotic is best described as ""creepy cute"": it's a taller, more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eyes as Morelull, but the additions of a blank, off-putting smile and long, green mycelium fingers through which it drains the vitality of seemingly whomever it sees fit, making for one of the more unsettling Fairy-type Pok√©mon; or, it could be described as a cross between a Toad from Mario and the Landlord from Super Milk Chan. Dangerous as it may be, it's not completely cruel; the anime shows that Shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a liking to, in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts. Its name can be broken down into ""shiitake"", a common edible mushroom that grows on decaying wood; ""shine"", referring to its ability to produce phosphorescent light; and ""hypnotic"", referencing the idea of putting one to sleep through hypnotism, the mind-influencing psychoactive agents found within certain mushrooms, and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerizing lights.

In most languages, Shiinotic's name pertains to mushrooms and light: in both Japanese and Korean, it is Mashade, and its French name is Lampignon, which reveals that its line also takes inspiration from night lights, lamps and lampshades. The Pok√©mon Company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the ""Snorlax's Yawn"" merchandise, which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of Pok√©mon-themed furniture, including a Shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an Aurorus dresser.

Before going into any more detail about what could have inspired Bowling Pin Toad's appearance, it would be wise to first explain its typing. Grass is easy: prior to the revelation that fungi don't actually photosynthesize, they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants. As for Fairy, fairies have been associated with nature, and therefore mushrooms, for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing. Over time, this has lead some lucky 'shrooms to be bestowed with such monikers as ""dryad's saddle"" and ""fairy inkcap"", as well as Shroomish and Breloom being placed in the Fairy Egg Group. During a time when people made less distinction between medical science and magic, the potential medicinal, toxic, or hallucinogenic properties of mushrooms earned them a history of use in ""sorcery"" and shamanic rituals, a trope that still persists in popular culture to this day. In fantasy stories, they're often used as potion ingredients by wizards and witches; funny enough, Shiinotic's design can be read as a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a cauldron, though it's hard to say whether or not this was deliberate.

The mushroom most frequently depicted in fairy stories and paintings, and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all, is the poisonous and hallucinogenic ***Amanita muscaria***, the red-and-white toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric. You know the one: sometimes it's shown being used as a seat or dwelling by a fairy or gnome, other times it is but one detail in an enchanted forest filled with wonder. It has since been adopted by popular culture as *the* go-to look for a wild mushroom, starting with Renaissance paintings and working its way up through Alice in Wonderland, to The Smurfs, to Mario and Minecraft, to even Pok√©mon's fifth generation of games, which used it as a basis for Foongus and Amoonguss. Some have also speculated the fly agaric to have religious connotations of varying levels of plausibility, from being the Soma described in ancient Hindu texts, to even being the forbidden fruit consumed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

The *Amanita* genus is best known for its poisonous species, including some of the most toxic toadstools known to man; while some are in fact safe to eat provided they are correctly identified, others contain downright deadly levels of toxins. Though Shiinotic may not be poisonous, lacking the type and only learning one Poison-type move, it shares some of the other trademarks of mushrooms in this genus, including a wide convex cap covered in patches or warts, and a volva - that's the pink, sack-like structure that forms the lower part of Shiinotic's body, a remnant of the universal veil that envelops the mushroom during its infancy.

In addition to *Amanita*, Shiinotic is based on ***Mycena*** fungi, of which 59 species are known to produce **fairy fire**. Fairy fire is one of the three names for the ethereal glow produced by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decaying wood, the others being foxfire and chimpanzee fire. In particular, Shiinotic's pink cap is reminiscent of species such as *M. rosella*, *M. pura* and *M. purpureofusca*; if we branch out to other families, an even closer match is the Pink Waxcap, *Porpolomopsis calyptriformis*. While foxfire-producing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium, the fruitbody, or both, the slippery mycena (*Roridomyces roridus*) specifically only has bioluminescent spores. The anime shows that this isn't true of Morelull nor Shiinotic, but nevertheless their Pok√©dex entries mainly describe their light as being emitted from their spores; likewise, *M. pruinosoviscida* is known to emit light from both fruitbody and spores. Other *Mycena* species that may hold relevance here include *M. interrupta* and *M. nargan*, also known as the pixies' parasol and the spotted pixie cap respectively; as well as several species that go by variations of ""fairy helmet"", such as the bleeding fairy helmet (*M. haematopus*).

All of this is, of course, a perfect fit for Alola: bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates, and Hawaii is known as the Rainbow State (hence Team Rainbow Rocket, the Prism Pok√©mon Necrozma, Minior's many colors and the bedazzling Bruxish). Hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light - mostly aquatic animals and bacteria, but also the fungus ***Armillaria nabsnona***, whose mycelium is bioluminescent. In general, *Armillaria* are better known as honey fungi, for many of their species have yellow, yellowish-brown or straight-up brown caps that match up with shiny Shiinotic's, such as *A. ostoyae*, *A. luteobubalina* and *A. mellea*.

Honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite: they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them, but they've adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter - they'll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes, regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in. While Shiinotic's signature move, Strength Sap, is obviously based on how fungi ""sap"" nutrients from their environment through their mycelia, the fact that it drains opponents of their strength yet gives them nothing in return brings to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their hosts, such as honey fungi. Shiinotic's default color scheme also gives it the most ""psychedelic"" vibe of all fungal Pok√©mon, which may not be entirely a coincidence: on top of its fly agaric inspiration, magic mushrooms - yes, the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids - mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics, including Hawaii, where you may come across *Panaeolus bisporus* and *Panaeolus cambodginiensis*.

Yet another potential mycological reference lies in Hachij≈ç-jima, the southernmost of Tokyo's Izu islands. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1960s, the government made efforts to promote it as the ""**Hawaii of Japan**"" to increase investment and property development. It just so happens that multiple species of *Mycena* fungus known to emit a pale green light are abdundant on this island, including *M. chlorophos*, *M. pruinosoviscida*, and *M. lux-coeli*, the last of which was long considered to be endemic to Hachij≈ç-jima until it was found on other Japanese islands decades later.

**Part 2: Mythological Roots**

As mentioned previously, shiny Shiinotic takes its color scheme from various honey fungi, making it the second Pok√©mon inspired by a parasitic fungus. The first was Parasect, and these two are linked in more ways than just sharing the same base stat total and evolution level: in Pok√©mon Sun, the Pok√©mon that attacks when you collect the Tiny Mushroom for the Lush Jungle trial is a Parasect, whereas in Pok√©mon Moon it is a Shiinotic. In Alola, Paras can only be found during the day, while Morelull is a night-only encounter. The cherry on top is this Shiinotic Pok√©dex entry:

&gt;Ultra Moon: When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!

Paras only appearing during the day is accurate to real cicadas, most of which are diurnal, but what about Morelull? Well, fairies in general have long been thought to come out exclusively or more often at night, including and up to the **Menehune**, a seldom-seen race of forest-dwellers spoken of in Hawaiian mythology. Though considered fairies, Menehune have more in common with dwarves, including their short, stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship. According to legend, the Menehune reside deep within the mountain forests and caves of Hawaii, away from any human civilization; stand at about 2‚Äì3 feet tall, barely shorter than Shiinotic (3'03""); and only be active at night, during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds, roads, houses and temples. They've been credited with building some of Hawaii's finest ancient architecture before even the first Polynesian settlers arrived there.

In contemporary Hawaii, the term ""Menehune rings"" is sometimes used to refer to **fairy rings**, perfect circles of mushrooms which can cause rings of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken, depending on the fungus (ironically, these necrotic zones are the exact thing Morelull does its best to avoid creating). It's certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy rings are in the *Amanita* genus, which Shiinotic is already known to draw inspiration from. Even outside of Hawaii, fairy rings lend their name to the vast folklore surrounding them. Let's take a look at some more Pok√©dex entries:

&gt;Sun: Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.

&gt;Moon: It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pok√©mon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.

&gt;Sword: Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pok√©mon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.

&gt;Shield: If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don't go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.

This is bog-standard fairy behavior. Many mythological fairies such as redcaps, boggarts, dullahans, rusalki and the nuckelavee were *highly* dangerous to those they crossed paths with; others were said to be or utilize will-o'-the-wisps - known in Welsh folklore as **fairy fire** - which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night. To reiterate, Shiinotic's territory is generally *not* worth the risk of encroaching on when it's dark out, just as European folktales would often warn not to step in fairy rings.

Since science hadn't yet advanced enough to disprove it, the appearance of fairy rings was attributed to supernatural beings such as elves, witches or fairies dancing in circles, and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depending on the tradition. At worst, consequences for entering them could range from being transported to the realm of the fae, to unwillingly joining in on the nightly dances until your body gives out. Legends would often paint them as being all but impossible to escape from on one's own, and since time was said to pass differently in the otherworld, your trip to Fairyland could have equated to weeks or even years elapsed in the mortal realm, potentially resulting in a near-instant death from old age after breaking free. The only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times, specifically under the full moon according to a Northumberland tradition. Other creatures said to be linked to fairy rings include dragons, giant bug-eyed toads, and even the Devil himself.

At this point, you may have remembered that fairy rings are not the only mysterious circles associated with night and the paranormal. One could say that **crop circles** are the contemporary equivalent of fairy rings, even if they aren't created naturally. In some ways, aliens are the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in today's popular culture and urban legends, sharing their unknowability, alien morals, and knack for abducting random people or livestock at night without a thought only to bring them back different, sometimes with no memory of what occurred when they were kidnapped. Fairies have enough parallels to aliens that they would fall under the infamous ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theory, which implies that mythological beings such as gods, angels and the fair folk themselves were in fact aliens who visited Earth long ago. Another discredited theory linking the two is the ""interdimensional hypothesis"", which says that sightings and legends of beings such as ghosts, fairies and UFOs are really cover-ups for visitors from parallel realities or dimensions.

One of the most common perpetrators of alleged alien abductions are the classic **Gray Aliens**, which Shiinotic lines up with surprisingly well. The Illuminating Pok√©mon shares the archetypal Grays' pitch-black eyes and short stature compared to humans; it has (hyp)notic in its name, potentially referencing the alien brainwashing trope; and its huge, dome-shaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarged brain or a flying saucer from which an alien may descend upon Earthlings, or use a tractor beam to do the inverse. Aliens being associated with light is nothing new, either. Some of the very first UFO sightings of the 20th century described them as fiery balls of light in the sky; for somewhat more recent examples, just look at E.T.'s glowing finger, or the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which colored lights are used to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

This is all too perfect for games titled Sun and Moon: not only are they literally named after celestial bodies, but they also introduced the Light Trio, the astronaut-like Dewpider, the miniature meteor Minior, the extradimensional aliens called the Ultra Beasts, and the seemingly alien NPC in Haina Desert who ""returns to space"" after being shown a Solrock/Lunatone. Moreover, Hawaii has had problems with alien (as in non-native) species for centuries, just not the extraterrestrial kind. Yungoos is based on invasive mongooses that were introduced to Hawaii to control the population of imported rats; the Ultra Beasts are extradimensional beings that are used to wildly different environments from Alola, making them too dangerous to belong there, and Shigeru Ohmori confirmed this to be what the Ultra Beasts symbolize in the first place.

Though there are a couple fungi that are invasive to Hawaii, none seem like they could have inspired Shiinotic. If its creation was influenced by any invasive fungus in particular, it would likely be *Saproamanita inopinata*, one of the two species of *Saproamanita* agaric considered to be invasive by the time Sun and Moon would have started development. *Saproamanita* are in the same family as *Amanita* and were once considered to be the same genus; some species can even grow in fairy rings. *S. inopinata* has not been observed in Hawaii, but rather New Zealand, which has also struggled with invasive species, starting with dogs and rats introduced by Polynesian settlers. This would still fit Alola because some facets of the region were in fact inspired by other Oceanian islands, most notably Komala.

Going back to mythology, there's one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to Shiinotic, and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan, you may have already guessed what it is: the **kodama**, literally meaning ""tree spirit"" in Japanese. Kodama are a kind of nature deity, said to be the animated souls of the ancient trees they inhabit; the few reported sightings of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orbs of light, or as lights with tiny humanoids inside them. The Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke has what is by leaps and bounds the most famous portrayal of kodama, depicting them with entirely white skin and black dots for eyes and mouths. Pok√©mon is no stranger to referencing other modern media (case in point: Lokix and Baxcalibur; even the very foundation of the franchise, Pok√© Balls, are an Ultraman reference) so I could totally believe that the Ghibli kodama had an influence on Shiinotic's design.

**The Verdict**

Well, that's pretty much it. In conclusion, Shiinotic is one of the most inspired, well-thought out Pok√©mon that Generation VII has to offer, tying together a multitude of mycological and mythological references from Europe, Hawaii and Japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldn't feel out of place in any number of fairy stories, yet also manages to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk. Taking into account all these different origins, it's hard to find a Pok√©mon more deserving of the Fairy type than Shiinotic.

**Tl;dr:** Shiinotic's potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades; mushrooms' folkloric ties to fairies and magic; a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a witch's cauldron; various fungi of the *Amanita*, *Mycena*, *Porpolomopsis*, *Armillaria* and *Saproamanita* genera, some of which produce fairy fire; Parasect, serving as its nocturnal counterpart and rival; nocturnal Hawaiian fairies known as Menehune; fairy rings, also known as Menehune rings; the double meaning of ""fairy fire"", referring to both will-o'-the-wisps and fungal bioluminescence; Gray Aliens and UFOs; and kodama, specifically the ones from Princess Mononoke.",legostarwars,pos

And finally  an off the cuff video essay on the battle system that includes a battle system breakdown with new footage, for those very curious how it all works and ties together.   You can find links to all three parts here and there is different info in all three parts so it‚Äôs my suggestion to check out all three.  Feel free to share them with whoever you may want too.

pokemon,Unova Pokemon weird move sets,"I actually like most Unova Pokemon. That was a hot take for a long time but Black and White are starting to get more love among fans. The issue I have with a lot of the Pokemon is their move sets are weird. I have a few examples. 

Jellicent can't learn Aqua ring. He is a defensive staller Water type pokemon it fits Jellicent's playstyle perfect. I love Jellicent but it is hard to use him. He is a bulky Water type. You want to know who else is ? Rotom Wash enough said. That is the problem with a lot of Unova Pokemon since in the first Black and White you could only use Unova Pokemon Game Freak didn't see the need to power creep them to incentivize you to use them like they did in X &amp; Y and after. 

Krookodile can't learn sucker punch. I can't believe this. He is a physical attacking dark type why can't he learn this physical attacking dark move ? It even fits his ethos to because Krookodile is well a crook. Crooks aren't know for fighting fair so sucker punch fits him perfectly. 

Serperior despite being a snake doesn't have many poison moves. He is a snake it makes sense.Emboar has more poison moves then Serperior. 

Scrafty can't learn Gunkshot. He is a lizard and some of his Pokedex entries describe Scrafty as being posions so him having more poison moves makes sense. Also it helps him counter Fairies. Not only that it fits with like his concept. Also the description for Gunkshot describes the user throwing garbage at the opponent. Scrafty is modeled after a thug who usually spend a lot of time in city allies where Trash is stored. 

My theory why Unova pokemon had their movesets neglected like this to the point of obvious oversites. Is that for the longest time Unova Pok√©mon were to old to be new and current but weren't old enough to be nostalgic.",pokemon,neg

CallOfDuty,[COD] Which streaks do you consider the most fun to use?,"List your streaks and possible reasons as to why you enjoyed using them.

* **Emergency Airdrop (MW2)**:  Oddly enough, this streak was the most fun not because of the rewards I took.  I was one of the 0.02% that would let my teammates take everything (even if it was something high cost).  It warmed my heart to be so generous.
* **Juggernaut Maniac (Ghosts)**:  It's one thing to be a slow moving hulking mass, but it was a pure thrill to move extremely fast with just a knife.  It felt even better when I could play as Michael Myers in the DLC map.
* **Flamenaut (Vanguard)**:  Let's face it--[roasting people never felt so good.](https://streamable.com/rihulj)
* **Chopper Gunner (Black Ops)**:  For me, the best part was getting pumped when sliding that helicopter door open and getting that mini-gun ready.
* **Power Core (Black Ops III)**:  This was an uncommon treat to earn.  However, it feels extremely satisfying to destroy a ton of enemy streaks at once.
* **Recon Drone (MW3)**: Yeah, you could say it was somewhat OP if you didn't use Blind Eye to counter it.  On the other hand, I would rack up around 20+ assists with this useful streak and my teammates were extremely thankful for it.
* **Sniper's Nest (Black Ops 4)**: It wasn't my main go-to streak since I prefer supportive ones.  I just really love the helmet cracks with every kill they make.  It's like my personal ASMR.

FIFA,How are you supposed to play this game anymore?,"Every single day the game feels completely different. Some games you have to pass to create chances, some days you have dribble to create chances, and some days you have to do both. Now it feels like you have to get random dda bs to even do anything. Every touch the ball goes 5 meters away from the player without even holding r2. Half the passes go to the wrong person and even if the pass goes to the right person it goes wide straight to the defenders. But that‚Äôs even if you can get a pass off with all this delay. No point of trying to time finish since it takes your players 4 minutes to actually let go of the ball. Feels like I have to learn to play the game again every day.",FIFA,pos

But my mom left the family for another man and me and my dad went to Walmart and walked pass the game aisle around the first few weeks when X and Y came out and luckily I had enough money to get one of them so I bought Pokemon Y and I been playing Pokemon ever since.

I climbed to division 4 and qualified for champs, and it's very frustrating. Everyone just has 99 pace players and either run down the line all the way to the box and pass it back to score a tap in or just through ball the whole game because second man press can only do so much. Once they have a goal they just park the bus. There's nothing I can do because attacking just helps their counter attacking strategy.

One thing to note is everyone has a fully meta team with icons and special cards I didn't even know existed.

I understand that this is designed to give some substance to this part gameplay-wise, but if you think about it, it does not make much sense. Why the gate of a laboratory located in the depths of a moat should have a security system that can be deactivated from outside of the lab instead of from within, without the need of identificating themselves? Then anyone can sneak into Area Zero, disable the locking mechanisms, and sneak into the lab at will.

On top of that, these research stations are located kilometers away from the laboratory, it's not like they're close, so anyone who sneaks there, is able to lock you in the lab if they feel like it; likewise, if you want to block access to the laboratory, you have to walk like 5 fucking kilometers.

pokemon,I was thinking about how history has changed things.,"In Hisui and older times, we see most pokemon as hyper aggressive. Using moves on people as though they were in battle themselves. 

However. We don't really see that in Main games. It could be hardware but I like to think of it that as humans started to bond with pokemon and they grew side by side together, maybe the pokemon of the wilds collectively grew to hold back against humans. We see legendaries still run at people or actively cause harm. But you don't see something like a machoke from the wild rush into a town and just start falcon punching people. In Hisui, they have to actively guard the gates from raiding pokemon. But not in the modern Era.

I wonder if as bonds between humans and pokemon have grow together, if tamed pokemon communicated to wild pokemon collectively that humans aren't a threat to be dealt with severely like they did in the past. And over time, wild pokemon instead of straight up trying to bash a humans face in, they would jump at a person to make their presence known and wait for a pokemon to be summoned before going on the attack and that's how things just are now? It's an interesting thought.",pokemon,pos

thesims,re: Why everyone is so ‚Äúwhiny‚Äù..,"For new players and long-time players who have played the sims 4, you can‚Äôt argue that the game is undeniably BROKEN and that the company has turned into a huge money grab to the point where they don‚Äôt even try to hide it anymore.

We add mods, CC, and even buy the EP‚Äôs to make our game experience more enjoyable because IMO the sims 4 base game by itself is utterly boring.

If you have ever played the sims 2 or 3, you would know that each pack they released had a LOT of content in it. Yes, there were always some glitches and bugs but the content we got to play far outweighed the bad.

Comparing both of these games to the sims 4, we only get a little bit of actual interactable content and we get more decorations than anything. The game is basically a decoration simulator especially with the HS years pack which was horrendous how the school lot was set up, all decorations and nothing you can interacting with.

The bugs and glitches are hardly ever because of the mods half of the time ‚Äî i.e my wedding stories. everyone who plays sims knows that mods get outdated with almost every update, it‚Äôs not rocket science.

We have to ‚Äúwhine‚Äù so EA knows what they‚Äôre doing wrong and what they need to improve on.

I play the sims 4 at times and the things that are appealing to me is basically:

‚Ä¢ being able to design sims nails
‚Ä¢ the variety of recipes and the festivals
‚Ä¢ toddlers

can‚Äôt think of anything else that imo makes the game good.

the camping pack‚Ä¶? trash. hardly anything in the camping worlds.

cats and dogs pack‚Ä¶? even more trash. good luck finding strays in worlds that doesn‚Äôt come in the pack or even getting your pet to breed with another pet that‚Äôs outside your household.

HS years..? don‚Äôt even bother going to the events. they make no sense. 

Dine out‚Ä¶? Broken asaf, your employees do nothing and it takes forever to get food. Ruins the whole experience.

Sims 2 and 3 weren‚Äôt even broken like this.

Hopefully, sims 5 will be much better with combined aspects of all the sims eras

pokemon,I defeated the Hoenn league for the first time! (Emerald Version),"I know, I‚Äôm almost 20 years too late to the party, but boy do I feel EXCITED! ü§©

As someone who has been on this ride since RBY, and is a diehard fan of GSC (my absolute favorites), this is a major accomplishment. Other than all of those, I only beat Diamond once, and that was it.

Beating Emerald was... I really had to overcome myself to get it done. Over the years, I made countless attempts, COUNTLESS. I would always eventually give up, for different reasons. I‚Äôll get to that, but I want to share with you what my experience was and what I like/dislike about these particular games. And I invite you to indulge with me in the nostalgia and do the same.

It‚Äôs difficult for me to pinpoint what exactly it is that made RSE just so... *tedious* for me. Yes, tedious. At some point, I would just simply give up. It felt like a drag. Especially the never-ending Surf section after Lilycove. Does anyone still remember the meme about water that began with the IGN review of ORAS? Boy is that true of RSE. This was the first game in the series that I EVER used repels. EVER!

And it‚Äôs quite a challenging game too. I mean... You have to understand that while I‚Äôve played Pok√©mon games since the series first launched, I‚Äôm not *good* at playing the meta. In fact, I don‚Äôt give a Hoothoot about the meta. More on that later... but yes, for me, this particular entry of the series has always been extremely difficult to beat.

In the previous two generations‚Äîwhich I played through dozens of times, especially GSC‚Äîit was always enough for me to level up between 5 to 10 levels between each gym and then clean up the league with my team somewhere between level 50 to 60. But in RSE, I struggled with a lot of the gyms, and just couldn‚Äôt make it past the league with my entire team at level 50 AND my bad full of revives, potions, status healing items, and so forth... things that I NEVER HAD TO USE in the previous two generations. In that sense, I feel like I accomplished truly something great, for my level anyway. I know that all you nuzlockers out there are peeing your pants laughing at me right now, but I feel darn great about beating Wallace.

Speaking of which, my team consisted of (nicknames in parenthesis) Gyarados (Shen Long), Mightyena (O‚ÄôDonnell), Beautifly (Amy), Swellow (Twitter), Aggron (Tony) e Torkoal (Oogway).

Shen Long was the total MVP at the league. I would not have expected that. I gave him Thunderbolt and he just wiped the floor with them. Before doing that, I just could get past Wallace. KOing his Milotic still proved to be a challenge. I actually just kept restoring Thunderbolt‚Äôs PPs until she finally ran out of PP for Recover, and then Shen Long KOed Wallace‚Äôs Gyarados last. What an epic fight that was.

You may have noticed I don‚Äôt have any of the starters in my team. I got Torchic, but I just... really didn‚Äôt want its evolution. I‚Äôm sorry, but Blaziken is just... so ugly. lol I‚Äôll get a lot of hate for saying this, but part of the reason why I always had such a hard time with this generation, is that I just hated most of the designs of the new Pok√©mon. You can clearly tell that my team is not balanced in any way. It‚Äôs literally just the Pok√©mon whose appearance I like, and I‚Äôve always preferred Pok√©mon to look more like animals and less like... things and concepts, especially chandeliers and garbage bags... In that sense, I feel like the designs are getting worse and worse with each generation, but... what can I do? Anyway, I found a team that worked for me, and I love them all so much. They did a fantastic job.

O‚ÄôDonnell was a funny story because I actually caught a Poochyena early on, but then found a shiny one elsewhere, something that happened to me maybe like 3 times in my life, and I fell in love with the golden fur. So lucky I caught it!

Torkoal was also a funny story. I originally wanted a Ninetales, so I waited quite LONG to get it (can only catch them at Mt. Pyre as far as I know). And then I used the only fire stone I had on it and only later realized that it wouldn‚Äôt learn any fire moves from that point on. So, I had to get a different Pok√©mon and remembered that Torkoal is pretty cool, so I got myself one. Very happy with it. It turned out to be quite powerful.

So, as you may have guessed by now, Pok√©mon for me is all about *the journey*. It‚Äôs an RPG after all. That‚Äôs how I play it. I go on a journey to become the very best like no one ever was. On the way I meet many Pok√©mon. Some of them I like so much that I decide to befriend them by catching them. They then join me on this journey. We go through many adventures and eventually defeat the league champion. That‚Äôs how I personally like to play Pok√©mon. Always have, always will. And I finally, FINALLY succeeded in doing that with RSE. I now have a story to tell, an experience to share. I had funny and touching moments overcoming difficult challenges with the help of my lovely team of Pok√©mon.

I don‚Äôt care about catching them all. Not one bit. I always hated to needlessly difficult it is, and given that from generation 3 onward I like the designs less and less, I also feel less motivated to go out of my way. The only Pok√©dex I ever completed was RBY. I had all versions and Pok√©mon Stadium for the N64, so it was doable. The only one missing in my GSC dex was Celebi. Never managed to catch/own one. Ever. I just never had other people to play with. Don‚Äôt even know if there are any glitches that could be exploited to get it, like Mew.

But with RSE, I feel like it just became too difficult. First of all, the games weren‚Äôt compatible with the older generations anymore. My guess is that the GB and the GBA cartridges/games just differed too much in technology for them to do something like the ‚Äútime machine‚Äù in GSC. I don‚Äôt know. But it was a bummer. Either way, they released those Gamecube games, which I absolutely hate. Never cared to play them. lol And then they remade gen I (which I‚Äôm going to play FireRed next, since I never even attempted to beat that game even once). I just couldn‚Äôt care less to get all these games just to complete the Pok√©dex.

And then finally... event Pok√©mon. I already find the idea of version exclusives dumb. It was Miyamoto‚Äôs idea as far as I know, and... he‚Äôs brilliant, but I hate him for doing this to Pok√©mon. It might make sense in Japan, where you can‚Äôt walk two steps without crossing paths with a kid (or even a young adult) who has one of the games. But in the West... like... I got bullied for playing these games, alright? I had NO ONE to play them with. I had to scream in parents ears until they gave up and bought me the other versions. And they kinda got tired around gen III...

So, to add Pok√©mon on top that are completely unobtainable other than through events that are never going to be held in my area is just... I‚Äôm done with this. Screw that. I enjoy Pok√©mon as a journey more anyway. I never enjoyed it‚Äôs collect-a-thon mechanics. They‚Äôre dumb and boring.

And let me use that segue to tell you about another reason why I disliked RSE so much: Everything else around it. All the other little things you can do. They packed a TON of new features and mechanics. Little side quests and mini games that, for me personally, add nothing to the core of the game. In fact, they bothered me so much, that I stopped doing what I used to do with the previous two generations, which was to strike up a conversation with every NPC. I was always on the hunt for new trainers to beat or items to get, but to me constantly met with little side quests, especially those that can‚Äôt be completed right away (or at all, like the many password-based ones), just made me not want to talk to any NPCs at all. The game was a lot more enjoyable that way. For me anyway.

And that leads me to the story.

RBY were simple games. They could only do so much given the limitations of the hardware. And yet I feel like the story in those games was more interesting and had greater stakes than the one in RSE. Feel free to tell me why Pok√©mon ‚Äúis not about story‚Äù hurr durr... I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs an RPG. If they want to be lazy with the story, that‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôll criticize them for it. And RSE just disappointed me in that regard. At least in the first two generations, you get a classic mafia-style group of villains with a head honcho. They‚Äôre there to make money/gain power. And that stands between them and their evil goals is you, the unlikely hero who happened to be caught up in the controversy but answered the call to stand up for good by fighting evil.

You don‚Äôt get that with RSE. The villains never give you a compelling reason why expanding the land mass or the oceans is good for everyone except only a particular class of people/Pok√©mon. And they use all means available to justify the ends. They leaders of each team has a change of heart at the end, but it felt meaningless. First of all, you, the player, didn‚Äôt do much. You just went and woke up the lazy green dragon who went in and screamed at the other two beasts to get them to stop destroying everything. And then the leaders of the teams... did they actually learn anything? I‚Äôm not sure. I felt like bashing their heads together and be like: ‚ÄúDUH! Of course your plans were dumb! Any reasonable person could see why!‚Äù So they‚Äôre not fully evil, but they‚Äôre not fully intelligent either, and it just feels like you‚Äôre chasing two children around. It‚Äôs a story that would have, realistically, never happened. It would‚Äôve made more sense to make it so the leaders were just out to destroy everything and were then defeated and made to retreat. Maybe they attempted something more nuanced, but it didn‚Äôt work for me.

I gave you a large list of things I didn‚Äôt like, but there are two that I loved.

First, the graphics are a massive improvement over the previous two generations. I love how colorful everything is. The landscapes feel larger and the journey feels that much more epic because of it. Honestly, if they got rid of all the all the other stuff, and focused solely on story-telling, they could release a 1,000 games with this art style and I would play every. Single. One of them. That‚Äôs just how much I loved the games.

I‚Äôm quite saddened by the transition of the series to 3D. Everyone will disagree with me on this... I think Pok√©mon should never have fully transitioned into 3D. If at all, it should have gone 2.5D. Imagine Octopath Traveller‚Äôs detailed pixelart, but for Pok√©mon. Wow! That would be fantastic! I feel like ever since XY the series has lost its charm. I‚Äôve heard it say over and over again that Gamefreak is inexperienced with 3D games (which... after releasing so many, is hard to understand), but... it really shows. The 3D games all look unpolished and cheap to me. I really don‚Äôt like it. Just look at BW/B2W2... they really outdid themselves there. That was peak Pok√©mon pixelart and I think that it could only have improved if they stayed faithful to the format.

But alas. I haven‚Äôt played SV, (too poor to afford a Switch), so... Maybe those did something different. You tell me.

And finally, I loved the music. I did. Pok√©mon music has always been memorable for me. There are so many tunes that I love to hum all day long and RSE delivered in that department too. It has a unique style, different from GSC (and GSC different from RBY, etc.), but still feels like Pok√©mon. The gym battle theme is quite epic. Always excited to battle another gym leader knowing that I was about to hear that tune again. The Battle theme against the Aqua/Magma leaders is intense too. And of course, the Elite 4 themes (although I was not as impressed with the Champion theme). Meteor Falls is probably my favorite theme in the game. Would totally fit a legendary encounter. I also surprisingly find Mt. Pyre Peak to be quite an ear worm.

I had to set some boundaries so I wouldn‚Äôt burn out again. Those were mainly blowing 50 or so repels on the water, not talking to any non-vital NPCs, and totally giving up on catching them all.

And that way... I had fun. Lots of it. It was an adventure. I enjoyed seeing my team grow. And after a playtime of almost 100 hours (yes üò¨), I‚Äôm ready to move on to the next game.

I think that, for me, it was more difficult to enjoy these games as a kid and a teenager. I just had less patience, perseverance. As an adult, I feel like I‚Äôm more aware of the finer details that make this series so much fun to play. I already beat Yellow and Crystal in recent times, and now I beat Emerald. Next I‚Äôm going to go for FireRed, which I never beat. Many years ago I beat Diamond, but I barely remember it, so that‚Äôs next on the list. And then I‚Äôll go for HeartGold, which I never even played, followed by Black (which I attempted once but gave up on) and White 2 (which I never played).

I‚Äôm confident that I can do it now. I managed to get past the one game that I‚Äôve been struggling with for almost 20 years. I did that by simply playing in short bursts. I would move the story forward until a certain point, and then spend a few days/weeks grinding once every while. While I was grinding, I would listen to a podcast or something. That made it easy to tolerate. I kept advancing, little by little, and finally reached the end.

Thank you everyone who made it all the way to the bottom of this wall of text. I can‚Äôt wait to hear about your experiences with RSE. üòä

And... I‚Äôll probably see you all soon in a few months when I tell you how FireRed went. üòÑ",FIFA,neg

assassinscreed,After just having replayed assassin's creed 3 (remastered) these are my thoughts. Unfortunately they are a bit less positive as when I replayed the previous assassin's creed games that came before this. What are your thoughts after replaying assassin's creed 3?,"Hey everyone ! (quick note: sorry if this seems insulting to your favorite AC game, I mean no harm just wanted to share my experience replaying AC3 )

EDIT: must make this quick edit thanking everyone for not getting toxic, it has been really fun reading all the thoughts and comments about this topic. Great to see that there are still places where you can share you honest thoughts and opinion about something without people getting angry or toxic. Guess I have one more reason why AC is one of my favorite gaming franchises, the community so it seems !!! 

Over the past couple of weeks I've been replaying all the Assassin's creed games. Right now I'm on Assassin's creed 3 remastered and I must say the game is not as enjoyable as I remember it being. I had to put the game down a couple of times with often the main reasons being these 4:

* notoriety system: it goes up way to quickly and getting it down is really annoying. For me the only reasonable thing to do was leave the animus and re-enter to quickly get this back down
* enemy chase and enemy spawn: trying to lose enemies in this game can sometimes take a really long time, even with smoke bombs they somehow always find you back. In previous games you could take out a couple of enemies first to make it easier to escape but in this game if you engage in combat more and more just keep spawning out of nowhere.
* Stealth: quick and easy this is just janky at best and almost undoable at worst
* overly ambitious: sometimes the game just was a little bit to overly ambitious imo e.g. the naval combat really wasn't needed for me and it didn't really add any value for me.

I know I'm talking about a game that came out in 2012 and that this might seem like a ""rant"" (which yes in honesty it is a little) but I was just curious if any other people that recently replayed this game feel the same way.

I still love all the AC games for many different reasons, AC 3 mainly for it's story, combat and Connor Kenway (who imo is one of the most badass Assassins in all of the games).

Ac will always be one of my favorite gaming franchises !",pokemon,neg

FinalFantasy,Am I supposed to be fleeing most battles in FF1?,"I'm playing through FF1 for the first time and I think I'm pretty close to the end. I just reached the Flying Fortress. I have a white wizard and a black wizard in my party and because there's no way to restore MP/spell charges when you're in a dungeon, I feel like I HAVE to run from 90% of battles just so I don't throw it all away on magic and healing before I reach the boss. These dungeons are long. It's a test of endurance and resource management, rather than skill. You have to prep for a long journey *to* the dungeon, *through* the dungeon and on the way back *from* the dungeon.

I'm feel like I must be doing something wrong or missing something really obvious. Like there's a way to restore MP while in a dungeon that I'm just missing. It *has* got better since the start of the game; the Waterfall Cavern and Sunken Shrine were the first areas where I felt like I could fight a lot of enemies without having to be as *ridiculously* stingy with my HP and magic as I was (although I was still probably fleeing from about 50% of fights, rather than 90%). Even then, I went into the Sunken Shrine with 99 Potions and burned through every last one of them.

I'm playing the PS1 version, FF Origins, if that makes a difference. It feels like this game needs Hi-Potions, Ethers and Phoenix Downs to be more balanced (and maybe a way to use Sleeping Bags/Tents/Cottages while in a dungeon, like in certain safe zones).

Edit: Looking up version differences, I guess I should have been playing the pixel remaster or maybe the GBA version for the kinds of balancing I want?",FIFA,pos

pokemon,"If there were another regional variant starter trio, which Pokemon would you choose? How would you change them?","PLA introduced us to regional variants of starters with their Hisuian final forms. There were slight design changes along with new typings. If this happened again, which three starters would you choose? Would you stick with slight changes or drastically alter the Pokemon? Maybe to the point of being a new mon as Clodsire is different from Quagsire. What new typings, moves, stats, etc. would they gain?

I'll get my idea out there.

Chikorita - The poor pear thing needs it. I'd keep the OG design the same but alter Bayleef's colours a bit to be sandier. Meganium would be more of a yellowish beige with a lace cactus flower growing on its neck. It'd be a grass/rock type with more of an emphasis on attacking and stats adjusted accordingly.

Litten - Stats-wise, it's fine, but Incineroar could've been better designed. I'd keep Litten and Torracat the same but make Incineroar more of a crimson red, be on all 4s, and have the tail be a larger version of Torracat's. Its typing and stats are fine, so it could stay the same.

Sobble - I don't know about its stats, just that I dislike its final design. I'd keep Sobble the same, substitute the green on Drizzile for yellow and remove that purple streak, then redo Inteleon. It'd be a bit thicker and kinda like a seaside chameleon, its eyes would be more like Kecleon's. The typing would be water/ground and it would be a more defensive Pokemon.

Another idea I have for this hypothetical region is that there'd be a ""nomad"" rival who's from faraway. Their team would be composed of Pokemon from the region of the starter you picked. So a team for a Chikorita picker might be Typhlosion, Azumarill, Heracross, Crobat, Wobbuffet, and Blissey or something like that.",legostarwars,neg

thesims,How I got into The Sims + A Question!,"
Hello everyone, so I thought I‚Äôd properly introduce myself and tell the story of how I got into The Sims! So first things first, you can call me Mer or Mercy! I‚Äôm 19 turning 20 and I‚Äôm from the US. 

I‚Äôve been playing The Sims for about 12 years. But before I started playing, I didn‚Äôt know it was a game and I watched Sims 2 and Sims 3 machinimas on YouTube. I was about 6-7. 

Around the time I was 8-9 I had the game on Wii and Xbox 360 consoles and found LifeSimmers Sims 3 Generations LP. This made me really want to play on computer. I finally got a computer and Sims 3 and Sims 4 to go with it. I heavily preferred The Sims 3 at the time. Still do in some ways but I play both a lot now. 

A year later the computer was broken by my brother (accident) and I didn‚Äôt have another (suitable) computer until I was 16. 

Do any of you have some memories similar to mine? I‚Äôm curious to know! 

Thanks for reading!",FIFA,pos

2. Assassins Creed Mongolia- Follows Altair and his family in their fight against Ghengis Khan and a Sword of Eden 

3. Assassins Creed Division- Connor Kenway and Arno Dorian track down Shay Cormac after the Dead Kings DLC

4. Assassins Creed: Blood and Iron. Takes place during the German Unification in the late 1800‚Äôs 

5. Assassins Creed: Jaguar‚Äôs Wrath- Takes place in Northern Mexico during 1519 and the Spanish invasion

thesims,"Toddlers are a nightmare to play with, and I'm not too hyped about infants because of it","So as the title should imply, this is a bit of a venty/ranty post, and not really a bug report, just gonna put it out there just in case a mod takes it down under that pretense lol. But for real, the infant life stage is in my opinion, the worst to work with. At least with babies you can age them up immediately (sure, you can do the same with birthday cakes and I probably should, but I don't for story reasons).

So, only two real mods I use are MCCC and Wonderful Whims, which I both turned off on the off chance that it was my outdated versions of those that were the problem here (it wasn't, sim parents are just that dumb).

In my most recent save, I had to delete my high chair because the mom kept throwing them in there when I tell her to change their diapers. An aspiration goal is to read to your kids, which can be done well enough as a child, but it's possible to read to your toddler and raise their imagination skill, right? Lol, wrong, either the parent yeets the book immediately after asking the kid if they want to read, or the pathfinding goes wack and they give up from taking too long. On that note, having the parent do *anything* outside of bathing them doesn't work; they can't put their toddlers to bed or feed them properly (see: The Highchair), so you kinda just have to do everything as the toddler.

I took the kids out to meet the kids of a family friends, which didn't work out since even though they're all toddlers, they still get upset trying to interact with new people. Now, this is fine, I could accept that, so I went to take them home and *oh my gosh it took me pressing the ""go home button FIVE TIMES to actually go home?* Only a problem because picking one of the kids up and down over and over.

pokemon,Scarlet or Violet,"I was looking for a pokemon game to play because I really liked the show Indigo League, and I like the cards, so I found knock offs to try to get the real thing(not sure why) but then ended up remembering me and my brother got sword and shield for Christmas with him getting sword and me getting shield. So I decided to ask him if he knew where they were so I could play it. We found sword and shield and I played shield. After that I wondered which I should get, Scarlet, Violet, or both.

GTA,Best Vehicle for defending cargo?,"Hi, there I have nearly everything in GTA 5 and therefore not much to do. Whenever I see someone doing a cargo mission I always try to defend them but I don't always come out on top sometimes people destroy the cargo so I want to fix that. I want a vehicle that's highly mobile but very easy to control can take a serious beating and can also keep up with all types of cargo vehicles. Typically I use hydra in hover mode but that makes me a sitting duck as I am too slow to dodge an incoming missile. I've thought of the oppressor mk2 but it's not mobile enough in my opinion and I've also outfitted it with explosive cannons because I wanted to turn it into a skill-based vehicle and not a crutch. The thruster and deluxo are too slow I've also thought of maybe using the Oppresser mk 1 but I would need to go back to the ground every so often which could result in them getting an easy kill on the target as well as some missions to take place in planes so I wouldn't be able to keep up or follow them above the sea. any suggestions? I feel I've exhausted all my options but maybe there's something I'm missing",legostarwars,neg

The only difference between switching from Cloud, Tifa to Barret in FF7R for example and switching from Pheonix, Garuda to Titan in FF16 is that you won't have to constantly babysit your Eikons like you would babysit Tifa and Barret. In FF7R, you switch between three characters who have their own unique abilities and role, but it's the same in FF16 as each Eikons fullfill a unique role. The fact that you're moving one character, Clive shouldn't distract you from the fact that you're actually controlling 3 characters in 1. Plus, just like how Tifa and Barret are not just abilities for you to use in combat but humans with deep stories, Eikons are also humans with their own fleshed out story arc. 

When you look it at it like that, FF16 is not giving up on the concept of party members, quite the opposite, it's trying to revolutionalize it, and I l'm hopefully that this, when fully understood, will get praised a lot at launch",thesims,pos

pokemon,Animelocke! (my personal ruleset),"Inspired by the recent post about the PokeCoach playstyle I wanted to share my personal ruleset that I run for my casual playthroughs. I grew up with the first few seasons of the anime so it is heavily inspired by how things work in it.
The Rules:
1. You may only catch the first Pokemon on each route (to foster variety in your team comp as well as echoe the rarity of new Pokemon in the anime)
2. You have to play on set mode (Nobody yells which Pokemon they use next in the anime)
3. No overlevelling past gym leader's ace (Makes for more challenging battles)
4. You have to match the number of Pokemon your opponent in gym battles or similar battles is using (sometimes seen in the anime, also for a little challenge)
5. No items in battle (would straight up be cheating in the anime)
6. No berries or consumable items (see above)
7. Only one held item per Pokemon per playthrough, items may not be moved (is meant to show emotional connection Pokemon has with item)
8. You have to nickname Pokemon (not in the Anime but makes for more personal feel)
9. If you already have a Pokemon of an evolutional line, you may skip it as a first encounter (dupe clause, fosters variety)
10. Shiny clause
11. No manual exp-share (switch training is allowed)

I use these rules because they lead to a (slight) increase in difficulty and make team building more fun (imo). It's not nearly as punishing as Nuzlocke Rules and focuses in roleplaying and fun üòä",FIFA,neg

thesims,Psychology study results from a study I recruited for here last year!,"  

Hi r/thesims, I‚Äôm back bearing research findings!

TL;DR: I recruited for my PhD research here and promised the mods I‚Äôd come back with the results which you can check out [here](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20758.01607) and [here](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35135.38567)!

For those of you who don‚Äôt remember me, I‚Äôm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto studying emotions and videogames. A while ago I recruited from this subreddit for one of my studies, and I promised the mods I would come back and post my findings. I‚Äôm also currently running another study to wrap up my dissertation work ([for which you can fill out the eligibility screener here](https://redcap.utoronto.ca/surveys/?s=W3RXR9PL7DPEJMWP), and find out the finer details about below!). In my last study, I was looking at two different aspects of the affective experience of gamers; namely, tilt and dysregulated gaming (i.e., ‚Äòvideogame addiction‚Äô).

For tilt, I wanted to find out the relationship between people‚Äôs motives for gaming, their ability to regulate their emotions, and their tilt frequency. What I found was that both competitive gratification motives (i.e., playing games to improve your skill at the game) and mood management motives (i.e., playing games to improve your mood) both independently predicted tilt frequency. I also found that emotion dysregulation (i.e., the inability to regulate your emotions) was only found to play a significant moderating role in the relationship between competitive gratification motives and tilt frequency, but not mood motives and tilt frequency. What this suggests to me is that if you‚Äôre often fueled by competitive motives for gaming and find yourself tilting too frequently, one thing you might consider working on is your ability to reappraise performance failures as opportunities for improvement to help manage the negative emotional sting that sets off the cycle of tilt. That being said, this wasn‚Äôt an experimental study so we can‚Äôt infer the causal direction of any of these relationships. Thanks to your participation, I was able to present these findings at a sport psychology conference in Montreal ([which you can check out here!](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20758.01607)).

On the topic of dysregulated gaming, I was interested to find out the role of emotion regulation as a protective buffer against videogame addiction. Most models/diagnostic criteria consider ‚Äòmood management‚Äô as either a core or peripheral component of videogame addiction ‚Äì which also makes intuitive sense; if you play videogames to deal with your negative moods instead of addressing the actual cause of the negative mood, you‚Äôre gonna‚Äô have a bad time. What I wanted to do here was take a more detailed look at emotion regulation abilities and how they relate to dysregulated gaming severity, while accounting for mood motives for gaming. What I found was that emotion regulation feedback responsiveness (i.e., your ability to monitor and adapt ongoing emotion-regulation strategies based on their current effectiveness) plays the largest protective role against problematic gaming both through its direct path to dysregulated gaming severity, and its indirect path through mood motives for gaming. Again, thanks to you fine folks being so generous with your time and participation, I was able to present these findings at a social psychology conference in Atlanta ([which you can check out here!](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35135.38567)). I‚Äôm also currently working on writing up these findings for publication. Let me know if you‚Äôre interested in reading the full paper, and I can share it with you if/when it gets published!

All this to say, thank you all so much for taking the time to participate in my research ‚Äì you‚Äôve really helped carry me through grad school! I have one more study that I‚Äôm running to cap off my dissertation that I‚Äôm still recruiting for. For this one, I want to take a more detailed look at how moods and gaming relate to each other throughout the day. It involves downloading an app that pings you throughout the day to report your current mood, whether you‚Äôre playing videogames, and a few other questions. I know that‚Äôs a big ask, so I‚Äôm putting up $500 (CAD) in prizes for this one. Every time you answer one of the pings, you get an entry into the draw for 1 of 5 $100 gift cards to the platform of your choice. If you answer 80% or more of the pings, you get a bonus full-day‚Äôs-worth of entries in the draw.

Also, it's such a bummer that one of the biggest advantages in this game is who has the slightly better server connection. I don't play much of anything else online, do games like COD/Apex have such a big discrepancy on ping/connection?

Edit: I apologize, I should have been more specific: I only want these replays as an option the same way you have the option to look at your manager when your opponent scores. I don't think you should be forced into this.",pokemon,neg

Splitting attacks into special and physical made for a fantastic upgrade to battling dynamics, and turned some less than awesome pokes into absolute powerhouses  (I'm looking at you DD Gyarados). As far as sprites, I would go as far as saying it peaked in Gen 5. Anything past that is just incremental changes, and quite frankly, I've lost interest. Sidebar: not a fan of mega evolutions.

pokemon,The Raids are NOT 100% catch rate in S/V... apparently.,"I was in a Tauros five-star raid yesterday, and after we defeated it, I threw a pokeball at it to catch it. It went through the ball animation, showed it being captured, and after seeing the loot screen, it went back to the overworld and acted as though nothing in particular happened. It didn't prompt me to name the pokemon, which confused me, so I checked my box, and lo and behold, Tauros wasn't in it. I even searched the boxes to make sure I hadn't just missed it or something.

Has anyone else experienced this before? I would have expected this to happen if I got disconnected or something, but my connection remained stable as far as I could tell. But knowing Game Freak's and Nintendo's sordid history with online play, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that this is yet another relatively common issue that I just wasn't aware of.

And would people like to see them again? There's also the case of special outfits used for certain scenes, such as Challenger Uniforms in Sword and Shield.

pokemon,Where do you think every main series Pok√©mon protagonist is from?,"This question is very self explanatory and because not every Protagonist has it explicitly stated where they are from, it leaves room for discussion. 

We can eliminate Red/Leaf, Lucas/Dawn and the Alolan Protagonists right away because Red/Leaf grew up in Kanto with Blue, Lucas/Dawn with Barry, and the Alolan Protagonists are from Kanto. A debatable location for Brendan/May‚Äôs origin is Johto, as in the manga (which has a questionable relation to the games) Brendan, who is the one that moves to Twinleaf Town (and serves as the protagonist) is originally from Johto, and we know on the games he moves from somewhere not in Hoenn. On the subject of Johto, Gold/Krys/Lyra are from there. The Unovan protagonists and Gloria/Victor are also from the region they star in. 
 
That leaves us with Calem/Serena and Juliana/Florian. The former we know is not from Kalos as we know you recently move there from a region I don‚Äôt know is stated or not. Juliana/Florian are most likely from Galar because of the Galarian Pok√©mon stickers in their bedroom (ex Applin), Skwovet in the living room, and tea your mother offers Professor Clavell.

Most Moth Pokemon have the common trait of shedding scales. With the exceptions of Frosmoth, Mothim, and Masquerain, all will kill you. Mothim will come home covered in pollen. This leaves Frosmoth and Masquerain. I'm not entirely certain Masquerain is an actual moth rather than an insect who uses its moth-like appearance to deter predators. This leaves us with Frosmoth. Its scales appear to be ice-like, so unless you have a water allergy, you should be okay.

FIFA,Rookie needs help please üôèüèª,"Been playing for a month. New to the game (and this forum üëã). Struggling in rivals (stuck between 8 and 7). Same issues every game:

1. Can‚Äôt get out of the high press. Passing lanes disappear and it‚Äôs like the opponent knows exactly where I‚Äôm going at all times. Is there a known strategy/skill/tip to counter this? Or (maybe more importantly) how to emulate it? What tactics are they using?

2. When I do finally get in the opponent third, if I don‚Äôt score then the break is on and they‚Äôre flying at me like a bunch of Usain Bolts. Now I know that my defenders are usually slower than their attackers, but it looks like they got these extra boosts and I can‚Äôt catch them no matter how fast my guy is (and I‚Äôm using Frimpong with pace 96). Feels like a skill/trick/button they use that I‚Äôm just unaware of‚Ä¶ What is this sorcery?

3. When I decide to go ‚Äúconstant pressure‚Äù, my players tire out around minute 60, and it‚Äôs a bloodbath the last 15 minutes of the game. Doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same effect on the other guys. And they press me all game long. What‚Äôs their special juice, and where do I get some?

4. Finally, any general tips would be greatly appreciated (eg, how high/low to push the line? width? key strategy or button that can magically change my fut life?)

Thanks for any answer/tips/help I can get.

FIFA,Mid Zidane - Short review,"**Formation:** 4-1-2-1-2 (narrow)

**Position:** CAM

**Chem-style:** Catalyst (I'm short on coins from all the premium league upgrades I've been spamming to get fodder to complete him, so currently waiting to get an untradeable Hunter #ballin)

**Instructions:** Free roam | Get into the box for cross

Mid Zizou is the most fun card I've used in any FIFA (I also had his mid version a couple of years ago, but he feels extra good this year due to the new body type / sprint type meta).

* **Zidane:** before we go into any stats, I have to highlight one of the best things about this card. You're playing with an absolute legend, one of the best footballers to ever grace the pitch - if you're a real football fan this will make you appreciate each and every game much, much more
* **5\*/5\*** \- no words needed here
* **Pace:** don't be fooled by that 82 - he feels 95+ (probably due to lengthy)
* **Agility/Dribbling:** imagine a truck with spheres instead of wheels - he feels like a taller, bigger Ben Yedder
* **Shooting/Heading:** brilliant, especially when green timed. Special shoutout to his long distance shots.
* **Passing:** exactly what you'd expect from someone with 93 passing
* **Physicality:** refer to the Agility / Dribbling bullet - he bullies most players in this game (except gold Milit√£o, but then again who does)
* **Positioning:** I saved the best one for last. Positioning is perhaps one of the hardest things to get a sense of based on stats alone (hell, stats are utter BS 90% of the time but that's not the focus now). Let me put it this way: ***he has better positioning than Kamasutra*** itself. He's just always there, whether to support build up play, finish a chance, head it in from a corner kick or even intercept passes (yes, he can defend too). I've never used a card with such an elite positioning and I'm telling you that that alone justifies the price tag.

The only negative thing I can point out about Zizou is his **stamina**. Depending on your tactics / play style, you're probably gonna have to sub him off between 60' (looking at you, constant pressure bois) and 80'.

I am sure this card will stay in my main XI for the remainder of the year (unless I somehow get a better version of him). 10/10 recommend it!",pokemon,pos

So my grandfather being how he is, bought well over 50,000 Pok√©mon cards to see if he had any good cards. He bought the cards from the swap meet and I told him that rare cards are the ones that are really worth any money. I've already looked through some of them and some are very basic newer cards. I told him that I dont think its worth his time when he has no idea about Pok√©mon cards to be spending his money on all these cards and to just stick with his sports cards where he has more knowledge in.

* A challenging yet fair and balanced league that supports the main plotline without overshadowing it
* A thriving story that acts as the game's most prominent feature without becoming the main selling point.
* A cast of new and old Pok√©mon, each with their own abilities and weaknesses, as well as their respective habitats.

They don't know anything about Ezio post Brotherhood, and we know that Shaun was writing all the database entries, so the question now is, who or what is writing those entries?

[AW]","My current rig is perfectly capable to run Advanced Warfare smoothly at max settings, no performance issues whatsoever in my end. However, I did notice that temps on both my CPU and GPU tend to go all over the top in a matter of 25-30 minutes of gameplay, usually between 75-77¬∫, but more often in GPU's case perfectly reaching 80-83¬∫.

FinalFantasy,Challenges in remakes of other FFs,"FF7 Remake is progressing and parts of it has been released. This has prompted many to speculate on the next possible FF that may be remade. But, each of them has challenges that Square must overcome.

FF1 to 6...
Art style is problematic. Does Square keep the chibi style or move to realism? FF9 has a chibi style in 3d, so it could work. But can it work for all? Earlier FFs would need more new content.

FF6...
The last FF game before 3d models. A lot of the humour and charm may be lost by moving to more-realistic art, which can be of benefit to the darker palette of the world that reflects on the seriousness and introspective nature of the feel of the game.

FF8...
The draw and junction system was and is controversial, and likely need to be remade. Eyes On Me is a song with licensing issues. Both can be major headaches to deal with.

FF9...
Probably the least number problems. Is the easiest the best choice?

FF10...
Wasn't there a recent discussion on this sub about turn-based battles? Do you keep it (maybe expanded)? The game still looks really good by modern standards.

A mega remake in the mold of FF7 does not need to happen. It can be more modest in scope, such as the Pixel Remaster, but a few more steps above.",pokemon,pos

assassinscreed,Assassin's Creed: Valhalla [872-878 CE] - Historical Inaccuracies and Fact-Checking the Series [SPOILERS] Part 1,"[INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/9gw78s/factchecking_assassins_creed_from_ac1_to_origins/): Entries on All Main Console Games of Assassin's Creed.

After finishing historical analyses of all the main games of the AC games up to ORIGINS and Odyssey, next on the list was Valhalla. However, I took a long time to get to play it and process it, mostly Covid but also Life. Luckily, Ubisoft took a similarly long break between this game and its next title ""Assassin's Creed Mirage"".

This Post was extremely long so I had to divide it into two parts. Will present links to [second part](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/10kkgzb/assassins_creed_valhalla_872878_ce_historical/) soon.

**TITLE:** ***ASSASSIN'S CREED VALHALLA***

**SETTING:** Viking Age England, Norway (and Others).

**TIME**: *Year(s) 872-878 CE*

**Valhalla can be understood as the third of a ""pagan"" trilogy** that began with ORIGINS, an attempt to take a series whose motifs originated with the Crusades and resituate it in an antique Pre-Christian era. Origins and Odyssey were effectively Pre-Christian while Valhalla dealing with the last major European pagan civilization (the Vikings) is effectively the bridging game. I am going to focus on MAIN CAMPAIGNS, and the Regional Arcs, and some others. This will NOT BE COMPREHENSIVE as an overview of the full game. I am also Avoiding DLC as is standard for *my series*, with the exception of ""The Last Chapter"" epilogue cutscenes and 'Discovery Tour: Viking Age'.

**CONFLATION OF NOMENCLATURE, PLACES AND CULTURES**

The biggest problem with the Viking era is that the period is filled with **conflation** in both history and cultural practice. This is a problem that AC Valhalla inherited from its sources, and from earlier popular culture representations.

* Throughout the game, Eivor distinguishes herself and her brother Sigurd as ""Norse"" compared to Danes and English. Norse refers to people originating in what we call Norway. We call it ""Norse Mythology"" even if the sources of the Norse Myth that survived come from Iceland. At the same time, the majority of settlers and invader in England and Frankia were Danes, while Norwegians like Eivor, Sigurd and the Raven Clan were far more likely to settle in Ireland and Scotland **(Haywood 109)**. So it's a bit displaced geographically, and it's a bit odd why they didn't make the characters Danes?
* One of the major sources of first-hand interactions with Vikings is Ahmad ibn Fadlan's account of his interaction with raiders from the Volga River who he calls ""Rus"" and described them as blonde figures with peak physiques tattooed from head to toe **(Haywood 183-184)**. It's (largely) from Fadlan we get the image in pop culture of Vikings wearing tattoos, which is a whole thing in the game but in fact that was a practice by Eastern Rus settlers not Northmen in England (who were largely peaceful and became extremely loyal mercenaries for the Eastern Roman Empire). The Anglo-Saxon accounts denounced Vikings for being primly dressed proto-dandys who wore rich garments, combed their hair and effortlessly seduced English women with their manners, looks, and affectations for grooming **\[1\].** Among the ""grave goods"" of the Vikings were intricately detailed combs and other artifacts. In AC Valhalla we have a Biker Gang version of Vikings, quite at odds with the assimilationist dandies of the actual Northmen Settlers in England.
* In terms of gameplay map, the England we see in this game is full of regional names like ""Sciropscire"" and so on, but the concept of dividing British regions by shires actually derives from reforms made by Aelfred of Wessex a bit after the timeline of the game **(Keynes 232).** The shire system of English administrative division originated in Wessex in the mid 800s CE and was never exported outside the region until *after* Edington (Late 878 CE) and beyond **(Morris 185).** I suppose the British Shire system proved useful for the game's map builders but it's a case of conflation all the same.

**MAIN CAMPAIGN**

Assassin's Creed **Valhalla doesn't really have a linear campaign**. It has a quest structure which you can complete in mostly any order, one that ends when you reach Level 280 in the game's XP status. This unlocks the questline that brings about the final missions that ends the story of Eivor, Basim and Sigurd, the three focal characters of the narrative. To reach Level 280 one has to complete all the quests in the full map save for ""Hamtunscire"" in the South. **Upon finishing the game's main story, you have to complete two more side-quests** (""The Order of the Ancients"", ""The Alliance Map"") to effectively conclude the main historical segment of this game.

* **Most of the historical figures are minor figures such as Oswald, King of East Anglia**. All we know of King Oswald was that there are coins minted in his name from the period, and he's believed to have been a puppet King of the Vikings. So there's literally nothing to be said for or against his representation here. The first villain of the game is Kjotve the Cruel who in history was known as Kjotve the Rich who was one of the many petty kings defeated by the legendary Harald Fairhair. The **""Discovery Tour: Viking Age""** points out the lack of historicity about Fairhair.
* In England, a lot of the regional missions follow a pattern: Eivor wanders into a region, intervenes on questions of who should be Ealdorman or King or whatnot, and in exchange gets a promise of an alliance to her ""Raven Clan"". This is roughly accurate to the current understanding of Viking conquests during the Great Heathen Army's invasion. The Vikings allied with local thegns, ealdormen, and Kings, and established their own client kings\*\*(Morris 212-214).\*\*
* Among the game's most interesting characters is Ivarr the Boneless, one of the famous sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, who like many Vikings is more legendary than true. Ivarr the Boneless is there to embody the ""Bad Viking"" but he's also a compelling villain who's entertaining to watch, that the story as it is kind of dries up after he dies midway into the ""Alliance"" sequences. He appears as an agent propping up King Ceolwulf of Mercia. In the game Ceolwulf is a Saxon king and ally of the Vikings, whose son Ceolbert becomes part of a cruel plot by Ivarr in his rivalry with King Rhodri. King Rhodri is an actual historical figure and he did in fact win notable victories against the Vikings as presented here. That said there's no record of any rivalry with Ivarr, and Rhodri's death and defeat came in a battle against Saxon kings (who he opposed as much as he did the Vikings). Here he's presented as a personal enemy who's brutally murdered by Ivarr and submitted to the famous blood eagle.
* The blood eagle is an act of ritual killing that has *zero* historical evidence. It's only attested in Norse sagas, but not in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle **(Morris, 197).** The most famous legend is when King Aella of Northumbria was submitted to it by Ragnar's sons in revenge but the Chronicle records him dying in battle. Most historians doubt this because it's only mentioned in Sagas composed orally centuries later.
* Other historical figures are tucked away in the corner. **Ganger Hrolf/Rollo the Walker** appears in the Essexe region story arc in a minor role as a 17 year old. There's little record of Rollo the Walker's life before 885 CE **(Haywood 97-98).** He's shown as a lithe young man when historically, Hrolf/Rollo was so huge he couldn't ride a horse, leading to his suffix of ""the Walker"".
* **Supposedly Ljuvina Bjarmasdottir and her husband Hjorr is a real historical figure.** But I've not been to locate any historical sources verifying this. Academic searches lead to dead ends. The one website attesting this claims it gets the information from author Bergsveinn Birgisson who researching his family history came across this material and used it for his novel ""The Black Viking"". I'm chalking right now to a ""maybe **\[2\]**
* **As Mary Beard argued recently, racial diversity has a long history in Britain\[3\].** The Viking invasions saw England reacquainted with global trade so in terms of verisimilitude I accept the presence of the various diverse characters here. Archeological evidence from Torskey reveals Arab Dirhem coins **(Haywood 53).** Likewise remains from the Jorvik Coppergate ruins have found artefacts from across the world **(Haywood 70).**
* King Halfdan Ragnarsson was, per legend, the youngest son of the Ragnarssons and also the most solidly historical. In the game he appears much older for some reason but he was youngest, originally. Within the game, we see him take over as first fully Viking King of Jorvik. Ricsige, the last Saxon King of York, apparently ""died of grief"" historically whereas here he's killed as a traitor **(Morris 214).** A major plotline in the Eurvicscire story is **""lead poisoning""** and the game repeats the story of lead poisoning causing the decline and fall of the Roman Empire **\[4\].**
* The **War with the Picts** is a bit unbelievable to me. We see Picts as woad-wearing barbarians from the Roman past, but at this time they would have been mostly Christianized and not very different culturally speaking from the other characters we see here. The Picts were also brutally suppressed during the Viking Age, and essentially subject to ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure in this time, so I think presenting them as essentially Orcs, albeit with a Glaswegian accent, is unfair **(Haywood 120-122)**.
* The regional arcs Gloucestrescire which shows a Wicker Man sacrifice is totally fictional, as are most of the regional arcs in places like Suth-Sexe and Cent and so on. The most important historical figure we see in the game is of course King Aelfred of Wessex, he threads through multiple layers across the game, including Two Epilogue Sections. In the ""Hamtunscire"" Alliance Map, that happens after the main (fictional) story ends, we see Aelfred confront Guthrum at the Battle of Cippenham, which led to Aelfred's defeat and fugitive retreat but which the game presents as a Pyrrhic Victory for the Northmen. This is of course a harbinger of the Battle of Edington whose aftermath we see in **""Discovery Tour: Viking Age""** and the Epilogue Last Chapter missions. The account of the Battle of Cippenham we see, including the attack on a Christian holiday, is broadly fair as well as it coming from a break in a treaty. The character of Guthrum, who we see briefly here, is shown as older when he was in fact in his 40s.

**MONASTERY MASHING**

The **most provocative gameplay loop in AC Valhalla** **is** the fact that your player characters is encouraged **to go raiding on a series of monasteries** dotted across the map.

* Obviously the fact that your protagonist Eivor goes a raiding and attacks these monasteries and somehow, implausibly, doesn't kill civilians is a total fantasy. It's true that Vikings weren't serial killers 24/7 and did combine raiding and trading, but on raid they did conduct acts of violence. In one occassion, the 806 raid on the monastery of Iona, they killed 68 civilians **(Morris 181).**
* At the same time, I wish Valhalla had leaned a bit into the **""monastery discourse""** a small controversy that first raised its head when A. T. Lucas first put forth his evidence that before and after the Viking Raids, a good majority of monasteries in Ireland were raided by native Irish Catholics **\[5\].** This thesis was groundbreaking and controversial in its time for arguing that monastery raids were not exclusive to Vikings but also involved Christian and Catholic figures. Now of course like all bold claims, it gathered pushbacks, qualifications, and emendations over time, but Lucas' main claim has endured and historians agree that the period before and after did have: *Christian on Christian violence*. Coupland's more recent article, published in 2014 has established similar acts of violence by Catholics in Frankia contemporaneous to the Viking Invasions of France.

&gt;In terms of the looting of churches, we have seen that there was little difference between the Franks and the invading Scandinavians when it came to the sacredness and inviolability of church property. Ecclesiastical treasures were stolen by kings bent on harming their rivals, by nobles intent on lining their pockets, and by opportunist thieves seeking to make a quick profit, as well as by Vikings who had come to Francia for the primary purpose of acquiring booty.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Simon Coupland, Page 95**

* In essence, the principal reason why the Vikings Raids caused so much outrage was that it was done by pagans against Christians, and strong and resourceful pagans at that. Violence at the hands of fellow Christians, or directed by fellow Christians, was a bit different and could easily be justified. Even King Aelfred of Wessex, presented in this game as a virtuous Christian ruler, and remembered as such in Anglo-Saxon chronicles, was condemned by the monks of Abingdon as a ""Judas"" who despoiled their lands, taking land and revenue from the monasteries for royal uses **(Morris 206).**
* The reason monasteries were targets for attack was that wealth was stored in these buildings. In addition, many monasteries in England were so-called 'fake monasteries' condemned by the Venerable Bede as a way for the impious (in his eyes) to use the monastery as an excuse to claim privileges that were otherwise exclusive to the Church **(Morris 143).** In AC Valhalla, we don't get mention of Christian rulers doing the same in past. Likewise, the Vikings themselves seem to on occassion, offer anti-Christian reasons for the raiding but there's no reason to think that the Vikings were motivated by religious hostility. After all many Vikings after converting to Christianity, continued raiding churches. In gameplay terms, each monastery raid has ""resources"" stored in these large ornate looking golden chests, and we need these resources to upgrade Ravensthorpe and get the Feast Buff or whatever. But the actual wealth stolen by the Vikings from monastery raids was relics, liturgical books, decorations, and slaves.

&gt;""Saints‚Äô relics were frequently housed in shrines embellished with precious metals and jewels, reflecting their spiritual value and encouraging devotion among the faithful...a list of the many relics remaining at St. Bavo in Ghent after the Vikings had been and gone included a spine from Christ‚Äôs crown of thorns which had supposedly been set in gold and precious stones by St. Eligius himself.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Simon Coupland**, **Page 80.**

In the game whenever we go inside the monastery interiors during Abbey raids, we hardly ever see the bling on offer, being scuttled by the Vikings. The wealth stolen by the Vikings were often sold to local and international markets and, in Coupland's view, often melted down by the Vikings to create jewelry, such as the silver arm-rings we often see characters in the game exchange during weddings and other ceremonies **(Coupland 90-91)**.

**SLAVERY**

The big elephant in the room with AC Valhalla is of course **the question of slavery**.Quite a few commentators have accused Valhalla of whitewashing the role of Vikings in the slave trade. That's true **but it's not just the Vikings who are whitewashed**.

* In the early mission where you settle Ravensthorpe, called ""The Raven and the Cuckoo"" after solving an issue caused by Saxon prisoners, Eivor remarks that perhaps they can ""trade him for a pig"". We see a more direct representation of slavery in the **""Discovery Tour: Viking Age""** story missions focusing on Thorstein, a sympathetic Norse tradesman who owns a thrall, treats him well, who attains manumission and then enters into willing partnership with Thorstein, his former master. **What the game misses though is acknowledging the existence of slavery in Christian Anglo-Saxon society,** the period of history where Catholics enslaved fellow Catholics, sold them to fellow Catholics, and kept them in bondage. Within the game, the few mentions of slavery are exclusively seen in Viking society when in fact slavery was rife across Europe and the Catholic Church was deeply embedded in the institution.
* The most famous anecdote about the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England, involves Pope Gregory the Great going to a slave market and seeing some English boys on the market and remarking, according to Venerable Bede, ""non Angli, sed Angeli"" **(Morris 58).** Not Angles, but Angels. What Pope Gregory did not do was free the slave boys, instead he purchased them and later dispatched and supported efforts to spread Christianity among Anglo-Saxon England **(Serfass 87-88).** Pope Gregory the Great, like many Popes of his era, before and after, was a slaveowner **(Serfass 77).**
* Slavery existed in Anglo-Saxon England, *before* the Viking Age and *after* Christianization of the Saxons. a fact not acknowledged in this game.  During the reign of the Mercian King Offa, London was already an international slave market, well before the Viking invasions **(Morris 138)**. Aelfred of Wessex *was* in fact an impressive ruler for his time and place, but the game ignores the fact that **Alfred's Wessex was a slave society.**

&gt;""An even more basic division was between freedom and servitude. Alfred's Wessex was a slave society. No one can even begin to estimate how many slaves (or free men, for that matter) there was in ninth-century Wessex, but from Alfred's laws it is clear that even ceorls owned slaves.**""**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Richard Abels. PAGE 36**

* Slavery of course increased tenfold during the Viking Age, as a result of Viking activity. Emphasizing the existence and continuity of slavery in Anglo-Saxon England is not the same as downplaying the Viking contribution in heightening it. It's absolutely true that Vikings targeted slaves in Ireland, England, France and elsewhere and that Dublin was the biggest slave market in Europe during this time. Whether slavery was an inherent part of Viking religion has no real evidence. After all, Vikings after Christianization continued being a slaveowning and slave-trading society, in the same way Imperial Rome, Byzantine Empire and likewise the Anglo-Saxons continued slavery. In general, the only significant exception was the Franks who did look down against enslaving fellow Franks (albeit not non-Franks) **(Coupland 80).**
* **In general for the common person, there would not have been a great deal of difference between Viking England and Anglo-Saxon England**. As noted by Patricia Dutchak, the Bishop Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, in 1014 CE, advocated for a stratified society where everybody knew their place and, ""He was deeply shocked that runaway slaves had not only been accepted into the Danish army, but achieved a greater social status and received more honour than their former masters"" **(Dutchak 36).**

The ""slavery"" discourse of AC Valhalla has led to some telling responses. This article by Brett Deveraux, shows up in a variety of places online **\[6\].** Deveraux takes issue with the game's presentation of the Norse as protagonists while downplaying and sanitizing their actions. The article talks of the ""Norse practice of slavery"" and claiming that Christians militated ""against the Norse practice of slavery"" while ignoring the existence and flourishing of slavery in Anglo-Saxon Christian communities and across Christian Europe. Looking at the game carefully, AC Valhalla does ultimately validate this ""clash of civilizations"" contrast more than Deveraux credits, but the existence of this ahistorical assumption and not overturning it is the problem here and AC Valhalla I guess ought to be credited for at least challenging this assumption somewhat.

assassinscreed,my problem with assassins creed history(specially mirage),"i wanted to talk about this with a community for a long time. i think now is the time because mirage is releasing too.so do you know that assassins are real? probably most people do but the thing that most get wrong is that they think assassins where arabs ubisoft frame it like that too. just like how they framed prince if persia as an arab.that's my problem because they deny a culture . let me tell you the real story.Hashashin  which means  **Order of Assassins**  where a group of highly trained assassins that was created by Hassan Sabbah. they worked under the persian empire but they did alot of secret assassinations too. there base od operating was **Alamut** Castle which is in Iran and it was already a part of the persians and there culture (note:they where not arabs they where persians)the part that bother me is that ubisoft never acknowledge this never made an assassins game in Iran the home of the assassins it has alot of potential . and im sad as an persian myself to alway be left out out of something that is built on from our history and culture.

assassinscreed,[AC Revelations] Forgot how scary the stalkers can be in this game.,"I'm replaying Relevations and completely forgot that the stalkers were a thing in this game and that unlike Rogue you don't get much warning that they're nearby except for some faint whisper, no ""A stalker is nearby"" message, no pink vignette around the screen, nothing.

I was doing the Mercenary faction mission where you have to save the wounded son of a mercenary, I managed to get to him undetected by guards for full sync, then you have to carry him to a doctor.

On my way to the doctor I start hearing some whispers which I assume are just part of the ambient music, I go around some crowds then in like not even 2 seconds one of the people in the crowds that looked like a regular NPC runs behind me and stabs me in the back, slash, 75+% of my health gone.

I screamed when it happened, then I remembered that yeah, stalkers are a thing in Relevations although they don't happen very often, can be hours between two attacks.

That was amazing though, I wish this had been implemented in more games, and I mean this type of stalkers, not the ones from Rogue that were lame, you have to be constantly on your guard with these stalkers since they can attack you at any time even during missions.

assassinscreed,The Journey in Assassins Creed Origins,"I just started playing AC Origins 3 weeks ago and am now 50 hours in and completely committed to 100% the game.  3 weeks ago, I thought I'd play like 10 hours and drop off because I was expecting a generic open world game.  And while there are definitely things that feel generic, I don't think I anticipated just how INCREDIBLE the feeling of journeying through Egypt would be.  

I know a lot of people complain about how huge the maps are in the new AC games and the level gating making the progression somewhat linear.  But I actually LOVE this aspect of Origins!  The way the game and progression is structured, as soon as you leave the tutorial area, you can see the Pyramids of Giza and the Lighthouse in Alexandria.  And those landmarks are visible for nearly the entire journey through the main plot, even though you are steadily making your way through the map.  

What this did for me is it really made me feel like I was in Bayek's shoes going on this epic adventure.  Yeah there are a ton of map icons but I constantly felt like I was discovering different cultures and stories in these different areas as I cut a giant swath across Egypt.  And each time I discovered something new, I felt like I had a snapshot of where on my journey I encountered this.  It never felt random, it all felt very lived in!  I've never really felt this way in an open-world game (and I've played tons, all the 3D GTA's, several AC games, Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, Breath of the Wild, etc) and its been intoxicating!

FinalFantasy,Ignis is easily FFXV's best character,"Spoilers for *FFXV*.

There is no denying that *FFXV* is often considered a mixed bag, and has a very mixed reception from the fandom. However, whilst the reception is mixed, when discussing it, I mainly only see negative stuff about it. I'll admit I'm a little guilty of bashing *FFXV* myself, at times. However, I do actually enjoy the game, and seeing as I enjoy it, and rarely see its good points discussed online, I wanted to make an appreciation post for my favourite thing about *FFXV*, and that is Ignis Scientia.

Ignis truly is the best character in this game. He has some of the best writing behind him, and he is incredibly fun to play as. Allow me to delve into deeper detail here.

Gameplay wise, Ignis is super satisfying to use. When controlled by the player, Ignis utilises ""spell blades"", which allow him to change his functionality whilst dealing elemental damage. Flamebind lands powerful blows on a target enemy, Frostbind allows decent amounts of area of effect damage, and Stormbind, whilst not good for DPS, makes a good momentum boost, allowing Ignis to zip towards faster enemies, and those that can teleport. As he attacks, his damage multiplier goes up, allowing for massive damage (Flamebind Ignis makes light work of even the Adamantoise - he's strong). He also can use Total Clarity, allowing for a big hit of elemental damage based on his current spell blade. On top of this, he comes prepped with Impervious, has a bigger window for it than Noctis does, and can use it to counter attack with a pole arm. He also can use High Jump for big damage, and Overclock to boost one of his elements at random, allowing a maximum of up to 8x damage.

More importantly, Ignis is one of the best written characters in the game, if not the number one best character in the game. I've said before in past posts how Gladio bothers me because of the way he handles Noctis in a harsh, aggressive manner when Noctis is in total mental anguish during later portions of the game. Ignis, however, once he cannot stand the bickering any longer, puts Gladio in his place for exactly this, whilst also getting through to Noctis about how he needs to pick himself up and be strong, and the magnitude of his responsibility. Unlike Gladio, he doesn't shout at Noctis, or try to bully him into bottling his feelings up. HE TALKS TO NOCTIS. As someone who suffers from severe depression myself, seeing Ignis step in and just talk to Noctis is great to see. He manages to balance reassuring Noctis with encouraging him to do what he needs to do. At the same time, he also has a go at Gladio for his harshness towards Noctis whilst also reassuring Gladio that Noctis can and will step up when he is ready to, and that in itself is a statement that further reassures and encourages Noctis, despite it not being directly said to him. Ignis is a true mediator, and an even better friend.

Furthermore, Ignis is the friend in Noctis's party that is willing to go the furthest for him. He sacrifices far more than Gladio or Prompto do, and in the alternative verses in his DLC, he goes even further, willing to sacrifice his life and soul to save Noctis both from his fated encounter with Ardyn and from death. 

Throughout the whole game, Ignis is the one to pick up the pieces, the one who consistently shows the most resolve, and the one who keeps the group together. He truly is the best of the lot.",FIFA,pos

assassinscreed,Ac1 does storytelling horribly,"Every time someone criticises ac1 people say 'its from 2007' so instead of criticising the bad gameplay, here is why the story is bad too.

Before i get into why the story is bad, i just want to preface this by admitting the opening and ending of this game are amazing. They feel like an amazing beginning and conclusion where it is engaging and lots happens. My problem is with everything inbetween.

&amp;#x200B;

Ac1s story consists almost entirely of going to do a chore because al mualim told you too. I get that its the point but it doesn‚Äôt mean its not boring. It can be just ‚Äòdoing thing only cause old guy said so‚Äô for Altair, but the player should have some sort of outside information and reasoning as to why they are doing it. Altair as a character is so bland, he and us have no motivation to care about why we should carry on the story. Yes he‚Äôs getting his gear back but we don‚Äôt see how not having it affects him not having it and that being the only reason isn‚Äôt good enough. There is no connection to him as a character or any connection to the story. The modern day has this, the mystery of what‚Äôs going on is so fucking good and Desmond is such a good character. But the story in the past has none of this at all. A way to maybe get this is to maybe make us see a scene of al Muslim being evil but altair doesnt, just like how we see omni man at the end of invincible episode 1. We as a player would then have a reason to care and carry on as we want to see what will happen when Altair finds out, this will use dramatic irony as a factor to keep us playing.

The story also feels horribly integrated into the gameplay. The assassination missions are awful storywise as you have no reason to care about what the people are saying or what they mean as the only reason both you and Altair are doing it is because you got told too, not because you chose too in order to reach your goal. This would be fine if the mini assassination stories were interesting but you have no personal attachment to the mini stories and thus have no reason t care about whats going on, the people you assassinate haven‚Äôt affected Altair personally in any way and the only time you know of the bad stuff they do is because you are eavesdropping on a guy saying it. 

The missions in ac1 are also bad because they feel disconnected from the main story and feel like you are just doing side quests. Altairs main goal isn‚Äôt fleshed out so we barely understand why we should be caring about reaching the end goal of killing all the people. And to both us and Altair, these gameplay sections are nothing more than blocks stopping you achieving your main goal, that is it and nothing more. They only exist as things you have to go through in order to get where you want to go, they have nothing to do with the end goal and you are only doing it because they are stopping you reaching that. In syndicate, the goal is to kill these people. The goal is to liberate London and to do that you have to kill each of them to help save a different part of London. These sub plots are integrated into the main story extremely well and you have a reason to care about what you are doing as you have proper reasons as to why you are doing it. in ac1 you are quite literally going and killing someone just because old man said so. You find out a few bad stuff they did but that is only when you are already in the mission and you only ever find out through word of mouth. You don‚Äôt experience any of it. And even if you did, that isn‚Äôt a good enough motivation. Even in the times you do know what the evil people did wrong, it isn‚Äôt fleshed out at all and its just someone saying ‚Äòguy did bad thing‚Äô then you kill them, the people have no depth or actions of them doing anything at all until you kill them and go into the same cutscene in the white room that is exactly the same as every other time you have had it.  

Your story needs to have the actions you are doing relate to the overall end goal so that you care about doing it. There needs to be a reason as to why what you are doing is necessary and important, just having them be barricades stopping you achieving it what you want isn‚Äôt good enough. Each action you do needs to build off the other and at the end you should have got all the metaphorical pieces of the puzzle that are necessary to achieve your goal. In a story, the actions you take need to be essential to achieving your main goal and it needs to be that the nature of that end goal doesn‚Äôt allow it to happen unless we do what we are doing. It cant be just because someone is stopping you achieving it by making you do this stuff, it has to be that the end goal could not be achieved by anyone unless they do these specific stuff first.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of how to do a plot like this where its revolving around assassinating targets right is in syndicate. You have to take down targets there but we have a reason to do so other than just because you got told too. You as the player and the characters have a reason to care about what you are doing and why you are doing it as well as goals to do so. You know who these people you assassinate are and you find out why they deserve to be killed as you actually see examples of why instead of just hearing one sentence. In syndicate you are doing everything to get rid of the corruption in London. Every assassination has a reason for you to care about killing them as you see how they have affected a different part of London for the worse. You have both the goal of liberating London and killing these evil people and those two tie in as by achieving one you are also achieving the other. You also have the reason of killing templars as you know their ideology and their grand plan. You are stopping the templars from having the overarching goal of world control. Each action you do has both the reasoning of achieving the main goal and also personal reasons as you see how the templars have negatively affected london. There are multiple reasons for you to be doing what you are doing and that gets you to care about these little sub plots and why you are doing them. In syndicate, the goal is to kill these people. These sub plots are integrated into the main story extremely well and you have a reason to care about what you are doing as you have proper reasons as to why you are doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

This reason is why ac1s plot is so good in concept but horrible when being played. The story sounds very good on paper, an arc about an assassin trying to redeem himself and while doing so finds out he‚Äôs on the wrong side. Its an interesting plot in concept, but it ends up being so boring because we have no reason to care. A story is only ever as good as how much you care about it. You can have the best sequence of events as a story but if you don‚Äôt care about why you are doing anything, it will end up being boring. If you don‚Äôt care about the world, characters, why you are doing things etc you will end up having a story that people don‚Äôt care about finishing as they have no reason too. If you have an awful plot but amazing characters that you care about and understand why they do what they do though, you will want to carry on watching/ playing as you are invested in them and their story.",FIFA,pos

FinalFantasy,SquareEnix‚Äôs pattern of trend chasing is destroying Final Fantasy XVI before it even takes off.,"*Final Fantasy*‚Äôs lack of a clear identity is a problem, but that‚Äôs only part of the larger issue. The fundamental problem is how it enables Square Enix‚Äôs habit of trend-chasing. Square Enix never intentionally positioned *Final Fantasy XV* as a direct competitor to *The Witcher*, in fact members of the development team even tried to distance the two games. Nevertheless, Square Enix did confirm *The Witcher* had a massive influence on *Final Fantasy XV*, including the latter‚Äôs semi-open world. While *Final Fantasy XV* was by no means that bad of a game, its sandbox map was the weakest part.

The fundamental problem with *Final Fantasy* *XV*‚Äôs open world seemed to be that Square Enix didn‚Äôt know what to do with it. Developers populated beautiful landscapes with overly similar encounters, and while the game features a ton of open space, players can complete the main story without doing anything else. Meanwhile, most important story moments take place in unique areas that the player can only visit once.

*Final Fantasy XV* had development problems separate from Square Enix chasing trends. However, that game saw the company move outside its comfort zone to capitalize on whatever was popular at the time. The attempt only weakened the brand by inviting comparison to other franchises.

Square Enix still seems to be chasing trends, reportedly basing *Final Fantasy XVI's* combat on the recent *Devil May Cry* games. Not only is this a radical departure from previous *Final Fantasy* titles, it‚Äôs questionable whether *Final Fantasy XVI* can beat *Devil May Cry* at its own game. Even if it does (**and it won't**), *Final Fantasy XVI* still deserves more of an identity than ‚ÄúSquare Enix‚Äôs *Devil May Cry*.‚Äù",FIFA,neg

CallOfDuty,[BO2] The horribleness of Black Ops II is deeply and incredibly shocking,"I‚Äôve been playing through these games starting with the first one. Right now I recently just made it up to BO2 after playing all of them in release order and I am deeply and truly shocked. Without a doubt, Black Ops 1 is tied with COD 1 for me as the best one. In fact I‚Äôd probably put black ops 1 in my top ten games of all time. 

While I deeply loved COD, loved COD2, deeply hated COD3, loved COD4, deeply loved WAW, liked MW2, was born to BITS by BO1, and loved MW3, so far these games have all been great fun stories to play through! I‚Äôm up to level 4 of BO2, and I was just starting to think 

‚Äúwow, treyarch really redeemed themselves after cod3 which was the worst! WAW and BO1 are absolute masterpieces, along with cod1 and cod4 as true GOATS! Arguably by far the best in the series up to this point!‚Äù

But this BO2 is just dumb. It strays so much from the formula that worked so well since the first game. They had a kind of simplicity and seriousness that carried over from each game to the next, smoothening things each time. But in the case of BO2, it feels like such a downgrade. With all the praise I‚Äôve seen it get, and completely having my life changed by BO1, I was really looking forward to BO2 thinking it would be the best. 

The textures and visuals are a downgrade from MW3 the previous game, which is fine on its own not a big deal. But then you have the janky animations and awkward gameplay. The previous games let you play in a realistic way if you wanted, and the atmosphere felt serious. This game has these stupid challenges encouraging you to do ridiculous things that completely take you out of the actual situation, like the kill 25 infantry with a rocket launcher, 30 with a sniper while trying to run away and save woods, go out of your way to kill 15 with a sword, when the level and story situation are not at all catering to you doing this in an organic way, and just all the levels feel silly like a cartoon. The music in this game is so much different from the music in BO1. I think of levels like the Kowloon rooftops and payback and the big operation in the snow, the way the atmosphere was built with all the lighting and intensity and music and everything. It felt epic while also feeling grounded and serious and just generally aesthetic. This one has this silly dramatic Indiana Jones music and just feels like it was made by a completely different developer. 

Even the characters feel like weird caricatures of the BO1 characters, as if this is a fan game made about the gang from BO1 getting into all sorts of wacky misadventures surrounding various conflicts. While BO1 definitely had arcadey moments and felt like a big action movie, it never felt whacky, and that‚Äôs the word that comes to mind so far from BO2. 

Then you have all these ways of straying from the timeless COD formula that‚Äôs worked from the first game up to MW3. If it‚Äôs not broke don‚Äôt fix it! The dumb tower defense levels, the new pre-rendered cutscenes that have the player characters being shown for long periods in dialogue and everything from a third person perspective. From MW, WAW, MW2, BO1, and MW3 you always had the cutscenes from a first person perspective, and in between missions you had the cool graphic style animations with exposition. That was awesome and it worked and it just kept things consistent. This just feels out of place. 

I just got to the level where you play as menendez invincible killing hundreds of people while taking hundreds of bullets and I‚Äôm considering stopping here. It‚Äôs so silly and dumb!

I am very surprised and saddened by this as everyone was really hyping up this game as the best one",thesims,pos

pokemon,A culture of Laissez-faire child rearing in these games,"I know it's in the ""beginner's guide to video game satire"" to point out how strange it is that these games star children running around unsupervised, catching and taming incredibly dangerous wild animals. Haha, very cutting critique, but I do find it interesting that the games seem to be mentioning and reflecting on the universal trend of adult negligence in these games and how that affects young trainers.

**Real Lax Child Care**

The problems begin with a global attitude of ""just let the kids get on with it"". From as early as kids can talk, there's a readiness for parents to let their children go out into the world. You're given a starter, an adventure guide and are generally expected to figure things out. Other adults will help you but never interfere too much. NPCs will ply you with items and words of encouragement but doing anything beyond that seems to be frownd upon. Just look at Bianca's father in BW.

**Absent Fathers**

Bianca's Dad stands out because so few named characters have significant relationships with their Dads, especially the player who's Dad is missing in all but one game. Not only is he there, but is one of the few adults who wants to play a more active role in their child's life and he's generally shamed for that. 

I'll admit, he gives off massive helicopter parent energy, but I can empathise with his concerns. The worries that it's too soon, it's not safe, or even just the fact that he'll miss her. I think this contrasts beautifully with Norman.

There's this tension between Norman and the player character in ORAS. The player's Mother notes how he's hardly ever around, he acts more paternally to Wally than to you and there's this awkwardness to the encounter you have with him during your gym challenge. In the cutscene after you get his badge, Norman speaks with Wally's father, another parent who put distance between himself and his child, and you can feel this shared remorse between them. A grieving over the time that they're losing with their kids, but that's just the way this world works.

**Neglectful and Abusive adults**

For the past three generations, there's been an alarming recurrence of children not getting the help they needed from adults. Guzma was physically abused by his parents but nobody came to help. Lily and Gladion lost their Dad and only had to live under the severely mentally ill Lusamine. Bede was ready to commit crimes to please his only parental figure. Team Star &gt;!were the victims of serious bullying while teachers watched!&lt; and of course there's poor Arven &gt;!growing up with only his dog for company.!&lt;

It's upsetting to think of how many kids are slipping through the cracks because cultural norms say that you should get too involved or ask too many questions

**Scarlet and Violet mark an improvement**

All that being said, I think SV have the most direct addressing of this trend. You are able to form relationships with the adult staff of the academy who enrich you with knowledge and are invested in your development. Then there's Director Clavell who is probably the most responsible adult we've seen to date. He takes responsibility for the carelessness of the school's old staff and dedicates significant time to ensuring the future well-being of the students.

The game does trip and fall with &gt;!the handling of Turo/Sada though. The fact that it ultimately justifies their inattentive parenting is almost as bad as SM having Lily become the primary caretaker for her abuse Mom.!&lt; Really fumbled the bag there but otherwise, a step in the right direction!",pokemon,pos

But I really wish before they started to switch back like I‚Äôm mirage we would have seen like a Japanese samurai setting. I think the formula would have worked beautifully in that nature, being as that the combat is so fluid you could be a godlike samurai. I always loved how quick and untouchable I felt in the games but it seemed a little out of place for a Roman and a Viking, like those guys should be brutes or something. (Not so much Romans but still I think a samurai would be awesome)",pokemon,pos

1) My sims will go to a restaurant, request a table, sit down, place an order and then they all glitch, stand up and are no longer able to sit back down (it says *sim* cannot sit at a table that isn‚Äôt theirs). 

2) I had them do this all over again, it seemed like it was finally going to work and then some sim comes over and steals the table.

I know everyone is going to say it‚Äôs a NAP but it‚Äôs NOT! I have entered every. Single. Neighborhood. To make sure that NAP is not enabled. It isn‚Äôt. Both of these things happen 100% of the time when they go out.

Nothing ever gets stolen on any other lot type, High School, Parks, Cafes, Thrift Teas etc, this ONLY happens at restaurants. Same with the ordering glitch. It makes Dine Out currently unusable and I‚Äôm losing it. Help!!",CallOfDuty,pos

assassinscreed,Your Pitch for a New Assassin's Creed Game(s),"We all do it: if you could pitch an Assassin's Creed game/games, what would it be? Gameplay? Gadgets? Setting? Characters? Story?

Not very original on my part, but I'd pitch three games set during WW2, following a single protagonist much like the Ezio Trilogy. 

The game would begin in modern day Berlin, with the modern day Assassins having received reports the Templars are searching for something there. Upon investigation, they're searching for a lost archive of First Civilization sites kept by Nazi Germany. Upon even further investigation, it's discovered that a descendant of the main character actually discovered the archive. And so, they break out the Animus

Then you go all the way back to Warsaw, Poland, in the year 1939. You step into the shoes of a young Ashkenazi Jew living in the city, who is similar in personality to Ezio in the prologue. In fact the parkour tutorial would be your character running from the angry brother of a fling he had the night before. 

After throwing off his pursuer, the character is stopped in his tracks by his father, a local doctor and respected rabbi. After a walking/scolding, the protagonist's father confesses his anxieties about the rise of Nazi Germany.

Jump ahead a year, to 1940, on the very day the Wermacht invades Poland. Just as they close in on Warsaw, the protagonist's father reveals he's in fact the Grandmaster of the Polish Brotherhood, and asks the main character to flee the country for France to warn the main European Brotherhood of what's coming 

After fleeing the city, the title drops as the main character watches Warsaw in flames from the distance. 

Cut to Paris a while later, and it turns out that against common belief, the Templars are not in support  of the Axis. Though some of their members share sympathies with their ideals, and even more have defected to the Nazi Party, the Order itself remains apprehensive of the Party.

To the point they've called a temporary truce with the Assassin's to discuss the coming threat in Paris. The protagonist attends this summit, offering their personal account of what happened in Warsaw.

Then, chaos breaks out. Both Templars and Assassins turn on their own factions, the Templar traitors being Nazi spies, and the Assassin traitors being Soviet spies.

The protagonist is tasked with fleeing to England, to pass on a message to Lydia Frye in London.

After a brief training section in England, the protagonist is officially inducted into the Brotherhood, and begins their first assignment: find out what exactly the Nazi's are looking for in Africa.

First game would take place mostly in Africa, with the protagonist aiding the SAS and local Assassin's stop the Nazi's from finding ancient Brotherhood secrets. During this, the protagonist's creates an informant in Erwin Rommel, who is at first a major antagonist. 

The second game takes the story to Italy, amidst the American invasion of the country. Mussolini is getting desperate, and is tearing Rome apart searching for something. You have to find out what.

Final game first starts in Warsaw, during the Warsaw Uprising, before moving to Berlin near the end of the war. Adolf Hitler has recovered the Apple of Eden Connor Kenway dropped into the ocean in AC 3, and is planning on using it to turn the tide of the war. 

Gadgets would be the usual faire, smoke bombs, knives, poison darts, etc, but the unique gadget would be the Welblade. Essentially, it's the pistol from the Ezio trilogy, but completely silent, at the cost of requiring precise aim. And of course, you'd also unlock molotov cocktails.

Gameplay would he heavily stealth focused. You're an assassin going up against soldiers with guns, facing them head on often isn't an option.

FIFA,Different game after every update,"Why does the game change in its entirety after every update. It‚Äôs so frustrating, title update 4 came with so many things that changed the game to where it felt like FIFA 21, then I readjust. But know since update 6 and 7. It feels like early fifa 23. I swear with no sarcasm, I went from winning 9-2 in division 1 to scraping it out with div 5 players on my alt acc after the update. 

Every first touch is horrendous, the ball gets away from players. Even a simple X/A pass they‚Äôll fumble it to a loose ball. Jockeying went from being semi decent, to going back to original release style where players feel like they‚Äôre on skates when jockey defending. After title update 4, players had to create intricate plays and passes, but after the new update it just went back to the old style where players just look for tiny space to burst past you even if they‚Äôre not wide open.

I could relearn all of this like again, but to what end. what if it changed again with another update where it feels like an entire different game. Is it too much to have a consistent game for a year? Or even half a year.",FIFA,pos
pokemon,help me decide,"Hi, friends!

I've been largely out of the Pokemon loop since Sun &amp; Moon and am thinking about diving in again. I grew up playing the GB games (was taught to read via Pokemon Silver) and fell off due to the repetitive nature of the franchise.

I ADORE games like Colisseum, GoD, and Snap, but am not too interested in the copy paste format of the mainline games (at least how they were since S&amp;M).

All this to say, what would be the best reentry point right now? I've heard Arceus shakes things up quite a bit, which I love the sound of, and I've also heard some good things about the newest gen.

Regardless, I'm excited to start back up again! My nostalgia has me tingling.

FIFA,Discussion: Is Fifa 23 better or worse than 22?,"Initially I was very excited about the new gameplay features, slower gameplay, an upgrade o physical players, it all seemed pretty exciting.  


Now, 3 weeks after, this is actually the most boring FIFA i've ever played. Everyone is parking the bus, playing 4231, low block, long balls. It's just boring enough that even though I LOVE futbol I'm seriously thinking about quitting the game or selling my account.  


Obviously, there's always a meta going on. But this game just makes everyone play like a bottom table team playing against the top 3 club in the league. I'm having a hard time enjoying this. I've been in DIV 5 for 2 weeks, just playing against dudes parking the bus and sending long balls to Haaland, CR7 or RB Dzeko. Any tips to get excited about this game again?

pokemon,A few thoughts about the Psychic type,"I've recently been replaying through Gen I and a random line of dialogue from an NPC in Pok√©mon Tower caught my attention

""Come, child! I sealed this space with white magic! You can rest here!""

Now this is unusual because the Pok√©mon games rarely ever mention the concept of magic directly. However, there is something fairly interesting about this. This is a quote from one of the channelers, or as they're known in some versions of the game, the mediums. Mediums, as a concept, is heavily associated with ghost communication and extrasensory perception, so basically psychics.

Now it might seem like a bit of a tangent here, but it will make sense later on. Have you ever looked at the kinds of moves Psychic types actually get? Most of them are some kind of statuses, and some of note are Agility, Heal Pulse, Light Screen, Reflect, Telekinesis, and Teleport.

Now on a similar note, have you ever noticed Gen I's Psychic types? In particular, Hypno, Abra, Kadabra, Alakazam and Mr. Mime. Notice what they all have in common? A theme of illusions and magic. Even the names of the Abra line, both in Japanese and English, are linked directly to the idea of illusionists and magic words.

So why bring any of this up?

Well, it's a thought I've had for a while now, but the one channeler has really solidified the idea in my head. The Psychic type is pretty much the 'White Mage' type of Pok√©mon. Agility, Heal Pulse, Light Screen, Reflect, Telekinesis, and Teleport? These all have parallels to things like Haste, Cure, Shell, Protect, Float and Warp from Final Fantasy. Now I'm not saying that Psychic types are outright based on Final Fantasy's White Mage, given that similar roles in other RPGs also exist, such as the Priest in the Dragon Quest series, however, the similarities between these kind of job classes and the Psychic type are notable, even to the point that they typically fall into the 'physically frail magic users' catergory.

And hey, given that things like Acceleratle and Haste are spells learnt by Dragon Quest's Priests and Final Fantasy's White Mages, that might add some context as to why Agility is a Psychic type move",CallOfDuty,pos

GTA,My ranking of GTA protagonists from most to least dangerous,"Except for Mike, Huang Lee and GTA Online Protagonist.


Here's my ranking of GTA protagonists since GTA 3 from most to least dangerous 



1.Carl Johnson : He destroyed the construction site, killed a dozen of construction workers and buried foreman who was in a porta potty alive under a cement just because some of them insulted his sister, broke into Area 69 alone then killed a numerous of there soldiers and stole a jetpack alone, jumped from a plane to open an another plane, killed a countless of soldiers, polices and rival gangs members in many missions, killed a lot in a various cities, took over the gang territories and has his gang rule in most areas in Los Santos. I put CJ above Toni and Trevor because he's machiavellian, opportunistic, has more resources, did more by himself and becomes pretty much a dictator of Los Santos' underworld in the end. 



2.Tommy Vercetti : He's cunnung, opportunistic, went from a bottom to the top, becomes a dominator in his city and willing to kill anyone who betrayed him and get in his way like CJ but way less brutal and has way less kill count despite Tommy has less emotion. 



3.Toni Cipriani : Although he's a Salvatore's lapdog and a mama's boy but he did some of the most heinous things in GTA series such as chopped a guy into a pieces then deliver it to that guy's own meat store and blowed up the whole of Fort Staunton neighborhood thus a countless of there innocent people died from that. In GTA 3, Toni also ordered Claude to kill a dozen in a several missions. 



4.Niko Bellic : He is one of a few GTA protagonists who will quit from being a criminal to be a normal person after the game's storyline but Niko was a human trafficker and possibly had killed a dozen before as he was in the war in his country (Serbia) and in Liberty City he also killed a ton. 



5.Claude Speed : He is by far the coldest GTA protagonist and he has no hesitation but I won't rank Claude much high because he has less kill count than some GTA protagonists and hasn't much brutal moments compared to some GTA protagonists. 



6.Trevor Philips : He's the most deranged GTA protagonist and he's also the only GTA protagonist since GTA 3 who implied as being a cannibal but I don't put Trevor much high because he wouldn't kill his best friends if they betray him and he killed a lot of people with Michael and Franklin in a few missions. 



7.Michael De Santa : He destroyed someone's house, tortured Lazlow and willing to betray his old friends and indirectly lead them to die if he see it's necessary but after GTA 5 storyline he highly likely to become a normal person and quit from being a criminal same as Niko but Michael is less deadly and brutal. 



8.Victor Vance : He's easily one of the least morally corrupt GTA protagonists but I put him above Johnny because Vic killed a lot of his rival gangs members and become a smaller dominator than Tommy until he died and in GTA Vice City Stories he's more successful than Johnny in GTA TLAD. 



9.Johnny Klebitz : He's a gang leader of the Lost MC, killed a lot of his rival gang members and tortured a guy with a motorbike tire but he becomes much weaker and a junkie in GTA 5. 



10.Luis Lopez : He's rather chill in most of the times but there are a reasons I put him above Franklin, Luis has more destructive moments and dropped a guy off the Rotterdam Tower (aka Empire State Tower in GTA universe). 



11.Franklin Clinton : He's certainly a pacifist compared to Michael and Trevor despite he also killed a lot, he didn't did anything really brutal and heinous compared to other GTA protagonists and he become a CEO and kind of quit from being a murderer in GTA Online.",FIFA,pos

pokemon,Cyclizar is a Pok√©mon that mimics Koraidon and Miraidon it seems to me,"A lot of people seem to think this Pok√©mon becomes one of the two legendary Pok√©mon. Or at least thought. A lot of people don‚Äôt seem like the idea because it makes the Pok√©mon less legendary in their eyes. And while debating whether or not a Pok√©mon is legendary if it can evolve/ is an evolution, it hit me that these Pok√©mon might not actually be directly related. Though I think some people may have figured that when team star was shown riding a bunch. It‚Äôd be pretty unprecedented if legendary Pok√©mon were riding around everywhere. There‚Äôs also it‚Äôs type which is dragon/normal. The normal part isn‚Äôt a coincidence, it‚Äôs there to say it‚Äôs just a normal Pok√©mon. On top of all this its colors represent a substitute. It‚Äôs move let‚Äôs you create a substitute. It‚Äôs not a legendary Pok√©mon, it‚Äôs a substitute. Team star uses it as a substitute because they‚Äôre not the main character riding the real legendary Pok√©mon. Being in the Paldea region with a legendary Pok√©mon that probably regularly traverses the region, some Pok√©mon might mimic it. Examples of mimicry already exists in Pok√©mon, ditto being the most notable example. Though mimicry has really only been relegated to transforming into other Pok√©mon thus far, this could introduce Pok√©mon that have adapted traits to mimic others. When I look at it this way, I‚Äôm not worried about the legendary and I actually like cyclizar a lot more.",pokemon,pos

FIFA,Few questions for a raging noob.,"I'm trying to get better, but one thing I'm noticing is I'm conceding from what I consider bad/easy goals. I concede a lot from through balls/when an opponent breaks through my lines as I like to play at a higher depth. So I was wondering for any veterans out there how best I can improve in certain situations:

* I always RB/LB jockey to an opponent in my half to win the ball back -- I don't know when to be aggressive or just block a passing lane. It feels hard to track runs, especially when they do it on the edge of the box.
* At what point do you guys press O to tackle, or do you rely on getting close enough and letting the game do it for you? Like before, I try to be aggressive, jockey and win the ball back as soon as my opponent recieves the ball. I know mistiming O can really set you back.
* I get most of my goals from cutbacks, but even they can be inconsistent when the box is too congested. I want to score more goals from through balls/lofted balls, but my strikers always seem to be tightly marked. Any ideas?

Let's just say I'm a lower div player, but my team would be good enough for higher divs. Clearly I'm doing something wrong as I should be smashing people in my div. I don't bother with WL as I was getting thumped. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",pokemon,pos

FIFA,FUT BD ICON Rui costa review,"Firstly , mind that this review comes from your average 11 win WL player for other average joes out there . 

I got this dude from the daily login pack and boy was I disappointed to see the Portugal flag after the seeing the BD icon card . Anyways , to the review :

Position : CAM / wide CAM

Chem style : Hunter / engine 

28 games ( All WL ) / 5 goals 11 assists

Pace : he‚Äôs not fast . Even with a hunter. 6/10

Shooting : Worst part of the card . Shot power is super weak and annoying . Misses so many chances . 3/10

Passing : if there‚Äôs something he‚Äôs decent at it‚Äôs this one I‚Äôll tell you . 8/10

Dribbling : Not the clunkiest man on planet but not agile either . Stiff even after applying an engine . 5/10

Physicals : gets pushed of the ball easily . 85 base strength my arse . 4/10

Workrates : med/med is just poor . Joined attacks late . 

I assume that anyone who‚Äôd consider going for this card is another average player like me , as high level players have already got way better attackers .

Verdict : 4/10 . Stay away from this card . BD muller has an insane shot and is way stronger on the ball and he‚Äôs fodder price . I‚Äôd go for that instead .

FIFA,"Over 134 Games I Took Data on Cards I faced, the Formations used, and the time goals were scored. Here are my results","Hi all, this is my third post on gathering FIFA data so if you want to check in on the previous check in's here is my [First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/11g1psy/over_40_games_i_took_data_on_what_cards_every/) after 40 games and my [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/11ormle/over_84_games_i_took_data_on_the_cards_every_team/) after 84 games.  With that said let's get right into the data

In this post I have data on:

1. What cards opposing teams use
2. The time at which goals are scored
3. Which formation opposing teams use

First off my demographic.  My average wins per weekend league is 15, I'm currently in div 2 in rivals but will be in elite by the end of the season, to give you an idea of the type of players I match up against.  The majority of my games in this data set are weekend league (113 games) and the remaining games (21 games) are in rivals.  If you're curious on region I live in the midwest of the USA.

# Opposing team's cards

As always I took data on the opposing team's starting lineups, first is the chart on all time data, here are the card's I've come up against since I started collecting data on February 19th:

https://preview.redd.it/6am8fl1hg7qa1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=10aded53e6c4620c140dff8bbb4726c021c4b14d

https://preview.redd.it/0yy6qxhig7qa1.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a7d210d3ad7694326274227732419d5a6d08b6b0

All time column is the percentage of all teams the player has been in, and the previous week column is how many teams from 3/20 to 3/27 have had the player.  The change column is how the percentage has changed in the past week from the all-time amount.

As you can tell a lot of the most popular players (Ramos, Mbappe, Jairzinho, Pogba) have all declined a lot this weekend.  I felt like the teams I faced were more unique and the data shows that, it was much fewer of the same players.  Zambrotta was the biggest riser due to a lot of players doing his SBC.

I also have a chart on the top 25 players from this past week alone, for reference, this was over 24 games:

https://preview.redd.it/ia6yxtywg7qa1.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=45701a8a6eed108d7a97223d62642bf00ba40b23

Personally, I'm enthused by how unique teams were this weekend, hopefully, this change continues into the future.

A few extra data points

* 52.24% of the teams I've played in total have a version of Mbappe in them
* I've played against 536 unique cards

# Goal Scoring Time

I started this section to look for what everyone refers to as scripting.  I think it's common for people to think that goals scored in the 45+ range are more common than any other minute.  Over the course of taking this data, I feel like I've shown that there isn't much truth to that.  This first chart is the total goals per minute, this includes all the rage quit games so you'll see it decreases as the game goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qus6mg3dh7qa1.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=78faebadf5011b0c4b4cde0c1d2fe44ffc7f4a7f

This next chart excludes all the rage quit games, so it is only games that went the full 90 minutes (or 120)  


https://preview.redd.it/h7s8obvgh7qa1.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3889fb8859e72596a321d467cfeec4f68731ec93

Looks to me from this data that it is very evenly distributed.  The only thing weird I see is that I can't score in the 34th minute but I score the most in the 35th minute.  I'm surprised there isn't more of an uptick when subs happen to be honest.  Let me know if you have any takeaways from this data.

One last data point.  Out of 89 games I've collected goal times on, 41 of them have been rage quits, that's 46.1% of games.

# Formation usage

I'm trying my best to capture data on formation, and currently have 41 data points.  Basically at halftime or the time they rage quit I will look at the performance tab and see what formation they use and write it down.  I don't differentiate between types of 433 or any other similar formations, but it will show the main correlations.

https://preview.redd.it/ecpgkzf3i7qa1.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2fad56709ca120fa268566dee4b5a6dfddb9fab4

4321 and 4222 were definitely the runaway favorites.  They are also unsurprisingly the formations I get the most youtube suggestions for lol (BEST META TACTICS \*BIG RED ARROW\*)

# In Conclusion (TLDR)

1. Teams were more unique this past week, but Flashback Ramos and Mbappe are still very prevalent
2. I can't find any evidence of scripting in terms of the time at which goals are scored
3. 4321 and 4222 are the most popular formations I play against

Let me know if you have any other data you'd like to see collected.  I feel like a lot of the community tends to go off of ""feel"" when making claims like ""I play Mbappe EVERY game"" or ""I give up a goal EVERY 45th minute"" and so on, so I like getting as much data as I can to prove for or against any claim.  Obviously, I'm only one person though, so this data can not fully describe the entirety of FIFA.  If anyone is willing to help collect data from their games reach out to me, it takes me 1 minute after every game so it's not a big commitment.

Hopefully, you learn something from this or just enjoy it, let me know your thoughts in the comments!",GTA,neg

assassinscreed,Valhalla‚Äôs cities suck compared to Origins and Odyssey,"
Athens is one of the best video game cities ever built. Places like the docks and acropolis made this city feel so alive.
Alexandria and Thebes from Origins were also awesome. They felt big, with surrounding towns and farms making the cities feel much bigger than they actually were.
These cities sprawl out organically. They feel bright and colorful and lively, there are more NPCs going about their daily lives and people come and go from the city.

No matter how much fog the game pours on it, it can't hide how minuscule London is compared to the endless stretches of nothingness around it. This is *the* urban hub of England. It should be a massive city with numerous surrounding towns and villages. Instead, it is enclosed by walls making it more of a hold than a city. Dublin has this same issue, it's like the designers have never seen a city before because they're too used to building forts. At no time in history was a city as big as these so enclosed and compact, they were and should be sprawling. Jorvik was a cool city I'll admit, though it too was more enclosed

The cities in Valhalla feel like they were plopped down with no regard to how they fit with the rest of the world around them. In Valhalla the NPCs don‚Äôt move much, and the civilian to guard ratio is ridiculous.

I started Valhalla not too long ago, and this along with the boring landscapes made me much less interested in the game than I was with the previous two.",pokemon,pos

assassinscreed,"Why I think Assassin Creeds needs to focus on Ancient Mesopotamia, or more importantly Ancient Babylon in the future. It could provide a whole new meaning to the Isu Lore, and Mesopotamian Lore is the stuff of legends itself. Here is my story of how epic it could be!","Hello AC Fans!

Consider this as my pitch for Assassin Creed Babylon or Mesopotamia! If you want to see a video of it me explaining in a little bit more detail then here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLDyuvXdIA0&amp;t=441s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLDyuvXdIA0&amp;t=441s) otherwise, scroll down for an EPIC read :)

https://preview.redd.it/qm2718p5lrma1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bbb0d1bdb8e0d028ea0ab81f9c9d5e2a39e7bf68

I'm going to be describing my thoughts as to what I think an Assassin's Creed Game should be like in Ancient Babylon/Mesopotamia. The Mesopotamian Culture is legendary in that its tales spawn epic tales of Heroes fighting fearsome giants, Gilgamesh going on I believe his twelve labors, though I may be wrong. The Gods of Mesopotamia provide ample content and lore to fill out the Isu Lore itself. I imagine going through the city of Babylon and exploring the Isu Ruins themselves. It's only been a while since we've gone out of the Acopolatic setting that happened with the Isu. This is my own thought of what a game could be like, and I've also added my video down in the bottom where my post ends. If you want to hear more of my thoughts, you can watch it and tell me what you think. More importantly, I want to know what you think!

I've also gotten comments detailing that going back to Mesopotamia would essentially be removing the concept of Assasins and that my post has a more mythical sense. I would argue that you could do a fully grounded historical AC Mesopotamian game in the style of Origins. But Mythical DLC sells I would also argue. In my game, you would the ability to play Historical or not historical. At the same time, I can see the GOW vibes coming from this post, but when I talk about the Isu in this game, they will be far more mysterious. They will not appear as the full Isu that we saw in Odyessy, rather they will be more human than Isu. It's the devices they use that will be more ancient in look and feel.

There would be a ton of stealth in this game similar to AC2. We could also have a fully grounded historical game centered on the Rise of the Assyrian Empire, the fall of Nebuchadnazzer, and the rise of Sargon of Akkad. These historical scenarios add a lot of depth. Yes, going back might not nesscarily be the ideal case, but since Assassin Creed is going to go so MANY settings in the future, why not have an Assassin Creed in this setting? I can certainly accept that this would be a spin off, but it would ideally be related to AC lore a heck of a lot more if I ever get the chance to write this or direct it, which is a dream far far away. But at the same time I just want to share my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kduh9cy2irma1.jpg?width=856&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e41875a3de5b770c02062331c8ac2794be283d47

In my setting, we'd start from Ancient Sumeria and show a cutscene of the Isu appearing to these humans that have lost their way. The Sumerians would be a higher class of humans that benefited from these Isu, but they were arrogant and begin to think higher of themselves. In an act of defiance, the Isu survivors wiped half their memories to make them subservient. The Isu then teach them the arts of writing, literature, farming, etc. All the stuff that you would see in Sumerian lore. The Isu begin to become part of the human race, with some electing to become Gods with the remaining power devices of the Apple being used by them.

https://preview.redd.it/mxud92jeirma1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=889a0b133d41f0a3fc4ce799807e15eab439b983

&amp;#x200B;

They became Patron Gods of the City and use a higher realm of conscience to build mythical realms to fool humans. They make humans fight each other. There is a strand of this Isu family that begins in the Sumerian part. They have a fight with the Order of the Ancients, another branch of the Isu survivors that hate the way the Isu treat the humans. They named themselves the Order of the Ancients because they believed that the way to treat humans was with sympathy and benevolence. Something their Isu brethren didn't do in the first place.

This Isu Family is part of the City of Ur, with their King Gilgamesh ruling. Gilgamesh would be a scientist, a God himself, and someone that doesn't take kindly to threats to his rule. There would be an epic fight that would cause Gilgamesh to lose his family and then they go into exile.  I'd use the Epic of Gilgamesh to use as my source material in order to fill the gaps: Gilgamesh would go to the Underworld and fight the Bull of Heaven, and the giant Huawa. Also, Aga of Kish would be the Order of the Ancients Grandmaster, and Gilgamesh would overthrow him and this would threaten a big war.

https://preview.redd.it/1q0byq6iirma1.jpg?width=564&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4cdb81b8e8f3443f8b1a1476731273851ae48131

Let's be clear on one thing: Mesopotamian sources are hard to find I believe, and they are not preserved well enough. So everything is open to interpretation in my opinion. The Mesopotamian afterlife was not as pleasant as one would think. In comparison, the Egyptian Afterlife is a better prospect!

https://preview.redd.it/jfl02qvodrma1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eca05160b803516aaa70d773145cebfa552d60d9

Returning to summarise the last parts: Gilgamesh would be an Immortal Isu, so even if he loses the war or decides after his epic journey to journey to Babylon, he'll set up his new family over there. From there, one of his sons, Maru is half-human and half-Isu. But he has never felt welcome in Gilgamesh's family and yearns for his father's love. But Gilgamesh doesn't respect it, seeing him as a cross-breed. Maru is then visited by the Order of the Ancients, that basically convinces him to go against his Isu brethren. The Order of the Ancients is led by Enkidu, who is jealous of Giglamesh and was his best friend. He would be in an artificial afterlife after Gilgamesh imprisoned him. By this time, we'd gone past the Sumerian period and crossed into the Babylonian one.

https://preview.redd.it/kcp69b59jrma1.jpg?width=564&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aef969244767b561b1cd364f2e7e0636579b75fa

Enkidu recruits Maru for some time until Maru realizes that the Order of the Ancients is wrong. He sets up the Assasins, to find out the missing truth about his Isu ancestors, and he begins to become its Grand Master. Soon a war erupts between the Assasins and the Order of Ancients within Babylon.  Gilgamesh alarmed hears of this and discovers his son is leading the Assassins. Gilgamesh has a change of heart and helps his son to fight the Ancients. And THIS is where you get the SOURCE OF CONFLICT that will erupt for thousands of years into history with the Assasins and the Templars.

Maru is then ambushed by the order of the Ancients, causing him to go into the desert. Maru would then be captured by Ancient Egyptian agents who see him as the key to unlocking the Isu Gods of their realm.

&amp;#x200B;

They are former Isu who were once part of the race, but then were thrown out in disgrace. Maru escapes, where he fights against mythical rock demons, answers riddles from Lamassus (epic mythical bearded creatures, explores Isu Ruins. This would be similar to Origins. And we'd be visiting the following:

\- A large open world similar to Origins with some RPG elements, and not too big. You'd have 5-6 cities, and you'd visit the most famous ones, you can visit and roam around the world

\- A afterlife similar to the Curse of the Pharaohs

\- Plenty of mythical cutscenes

\- The City of Babylon

\- Isu Ruins

\- Some functioning Isu Temples

\- Ancient Ruins

\- Mythical Creatures

\- Interacting with Mesopotamian Gods

At the same time, a Historical Game would remove the Gods, and only have cutscenes. It would also focus on:

Rise of the Assyrian Empire, the fall of Nebuchadnezzar, and the rise of Sargon of Akkad.

It would also focus on the epic wars that were fought between the cities, and chariots! Lots of chariots!

Back to the story: Maru would then be entering into realms of the afterlife and fighting the Gods, who are pretty much not that benevolent and are like the Greek Gods. He'd be asking and demanding questions, as to why the Isu perished and what happened because of that. And that's where I'd stop. He would have to decide, whether he abandons his time as an Assassin, or he continues and creates the brotherhood. But you could say that Origins was the founding of the brotherhood. Yes. But Maru would be the precursor to it, he'd set up the ideology and what it means etc. If there is a contradiction correct me on it!

FinalFantasy,FF Turn-based Games Sell More Units,"The developers of FFXVI explained that FFXVI will not be turn-based because numbered FF entries are very expensive to make, and they want to bring in new players that would otherwise be put off by turn-based combat.

However, looking at sales figures and inflation-adjusted totals (vgsales, statista, and others), it looks like the turn-based FF games consistently outsell the action-oriented games by a wide margin - especially the spin-offs. Even considering only the numbered FF entries, the games with action elements sell okay, but they don't earn the same money as the turn-based entries (I'm only considering numbered FF entries released worldwide).

So the goal of this post is not to debate turn-based vs. action FF games - it is to wonder why Square is citing sales/profit as their reason for moving away from turn-based gameplay when the data clearly shows this is not the case?",pokemon,pos

Considering they were a secret society that actually existed, and they fought for the poor people and against corruption and power","&gt;The ""Beati Paoli"" (Blessed Pauls) was a secret society that was active in Palermo, Sicily in the late 18th and 19th centuries. The society was known for its strict code of secrecy and its use of violence to achieve its goals, which included protecting the poor and oppressed from the wealthy and powerful. It was also said to have a strong sense of community and to have provided assistance to the needy. The society's members were said to be made up of working-class people and peasants who were unhappy with the social and economic conditions of the time. They met in Palermo's underground hideouts. Despite its criminal activities, the society was considered a Robin Hood-like figure by the poor and oppressed, and was seen as a symbol of resistance against the wealthy and powerful. They were feared by both the local authorities and the wealthy landowners. The society was eventually suppressed by the government in the late 19th century, but legends about the ""Beati Paoli"" continue to be passed down in Palermo to this day.",pokemon,neg

The way I found these is by default they are sorted by highest quick sell but only gold untradeables show up on the first page, so I sorted the kits by most recent, the usual gold untradeables showed up but there was a tradeable bronze among them. So I went back to sort them again by highest quick sell and lo and behold, 66 bronze kits showed up.

So I went and checked every stadium item, turned some pages then went back to list them again (it's not possible to sort some of them by anything) and there they were, tifos, templates, crowd chants, etc. all tradeable, all forgotten.

So even if you think you're rinsing regularly, like me, it's worth double checking because the app is buggy. I just found 20k coins worth of disposable stuff in my club.",FIFA,pos

Tetris,Why I think TKI is kinda overrated.,"Okay I know that‚Äôs a very controversial statement but hear me out.

Disclaimer: pretty much nothing I‚Äôm about to say applies at the higher level of the game. I understand that around U and X rank, the ability to transition to the mid game and cancel opposing openers is invaluable. I‚Äôm mostly talking about using TKI below U rank. Also you can pretty much disregard this if you‚Äôre confident with LST as that‚Äôs also really powerful because of the use of TKI.

So firstly TKI is not a killer opener. And that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not meant to be and it‚Äôs a great counter against typical kill openers(SDPC, stickspin,ms2, etc). My main argument against TKI is that there isn‚Äôt much of a reason to do it instead of 6-3 stacking if you cannot LST. In tetrio, B2B chaining is extremely powerful. TKI allows you to get 3 pretty much guaranteed TSDs regardless of your free styling abilities. But once you‚Äôre there, you don‚Äôt have a ton of resources. If you want to maintain your B2B chain, you need to either do LST (which most people can‚Äôt) or 2-7 stack. If you decide to break the chain then why did you TKI in the first place? 6-3 stacking is less efficient at the start but trying to maintain speed and flatness after the TKI is not easy and as mentioned earlier, your B2B chain is probably broken. 

If you‚Äôre not going to win off the opener or get a chain as soon as possible, why use TKI?

I‚Äôm definitely not an expert but in my experience, TKI has been the weakest opener that I‚Äôve learned. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very viable at most levels. But don‚Äôt let some stranger stop you if you main this opener. This is just my thoughts.

Anyways, I‚Äôm gonna grab my riot shield for this comment section.",assassinscreed,pos

Do you guys even like the new cod games? I wish activision wasnt so hungry for money I personally think all the attention is going into juicing players for money instead of focusing on creating new experiences, which is why the last 4 cod games are essentially copy and pasted versions of each other with different maps, movement tweaks, etc.

And now with this leak from a couple days ago that says they are releasing a $70 COD game this year thats still going to be MW2, but like a big content updated mw2? IDK you'd have to look into it yourself but they're basically going to be reselling MW2 at full price, with what my guess would be minor changes.

I know that when I was 10 years old, I‚Äôd always quickly mention a cool thing I did that related to the conversation I was having. I guess maybe Ash is just wise for his age. Perhaps it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs been 10 years old for like what, two decades now? I always forget.

Why is it that so many pokemon (alcremie, tinkaton, etc.) are female only? Specifically fairy types. I don't hate women, in fact I love women, but come on, it feels like game freak just doesn't want to make different designs for different genders, so makes it one gender only???

Or is it just because cute pokemon aren't allowed to be male?

Idk, but I would like to see more pokemon that can be available in both genders.

I like to balance my team in genders: 2 genderless, 2 male and 2 female. When I have a female starter and another female pokemon, i just cant have one of these on my team???

Is it only me annoyed by these decisions? Am I just sexist??? Please tell me.

pokemon,Pokemon games could learn from Digimon,"I just recently finished Pokemon Scarlet and loved it. Of course it has its flaws (performance wise and content wise) but all in all I think the Pokemon game formula is changing to the right direction.

Yesterday I started playing Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth. This is kind of my first step into the Digimon world, although I watched a few movies and episodes when I was young (20 years ago). What first hit me is how smooth the game feels and I LOVE the dialogue concept. Having main characters voiced is so immersive and seeing them animated at the same time with fantastic reactions is amazing. And the cutscenes are also beautiful.

For me this is something I'd like to see in Pokemon. I think major characters could be a lot more relatable if they were given voice acting. I also feel pokemon could do without a completely open world.

My point is mainly, pokemon could do so much more to enhance player experience by making npcs more lively, most importantly giving them a voice.",legostarwars,pos

pokemon,"We're getting a sequel for Gen 9, and the Gen 5 remake in Gen 10. Here's why:","Pokemon has always followed a pattern dating all the way back to Gen 1. Odd numbered gens got an enhanced version, that expanded upon/improved the previous games story and content, and even numbered gens got a remake. There are two exceptions, Crystal for Gen 2 and FRLG for Gen 3 but a valid argument could be made that the first Kanto ""remake"" was in Gen 2 since it was included in the post game, but it's not the strongest argument. For the odd gens we got the enhanced versions Yellow, Emerald, Black 2/White 2, and USUM, gens 1, 3, 5, and 7 respectively. For even gens we got the remakes GSC post game (again, valid argument to say it's not a remake), HGSS, ORAS, and BDSP, gens 2, 4, 6, and 8 respectively. I predict that they will do an enhanced version for SV and it will either be a continuation of the story, focusing on the origin/secret of paradox pokemon now running rampant now that the secret of terrastalizing is revealed in the DLC (yes i know their origin is time travel but time travel doesnt explain Walking Wake, alternate universe INSTEAD of time travel maybe?), or revamp of the story to also include paradox pokemon origins and essentially be a longer SV, with DLC included as part of the main package with more potential DLC",legostarwars,neg

FinalFantasy,FF I Thoughts,"I'm trying to beat all the Final Fantasy games I've always loved them but I have only played like half of them and beaten less than that.  Anyway just finished one last night and it was honestly great.  There was def some weird stuff but over all a super enjoyable experience. A simple clean cut story moved things along. I liked the building of your party at the beginning which was unique but I feel like that concept would get better with more playthroughs as you start to understand the different classes. Which I went with a warrior, a monk, a white mage, and a black mage.  One of the weirdest mechanics in the game to me was that basically all of the items in the game passed the first two hours was for the warrior. my progress with everyone else felt very very slow. It didn't help that I had nunchucks equiped to my monk that was pretty brutal hindering his attacks until near the end of the game, So I spent the whole game thinking he was just a straight up worse warrior. I also thought it was weird he got no abilities the whole game, which I didnt go back and check once I changed classes so things could have been different then.  I thought it was interesting that you could buy ethers and got to see for myself why they eliminated buying them in later games lol.  The only thing I really really hated was there was a couple dungeon rooms that had exactly the same screens and they were long enough that  I thought it was a puzzle room but nope you just had to try every door.  I feel like you could play it again and really get creative with the abilities. like by the end I found out temper stacks and I was just making a powerhouse, overall loved it and what a great start to the series.

pokemon,Which Pok√©mon Game on Switch should I get for my 6 year old nephew? (It‚Äôs his first Pok√©mon game),"My nephew‚Äôs 6th birthday is soon and he‚Äôs lucky enough to have got a Switch for last Christmas - so it‚Äôs time for his first Pok√©mon game!

Which would you recommend? (and let me know why in the comments)

Bonus points if your perspective is based on your personal experience with your kids/younger siblings/family around my nephew‚Äôs age! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My thoughts: 

Looking for guidance as I want to get the best game for my nephew‚Äôs enjoyment over my obvious bias for the original Kanto world! 

I‚Äôm an old school Pok√©mon fan, played Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/Silver/Crystal/Ruby/Sapphire back when they came out in 1999-2003.

My heart says Let‚Äôs Go Pikachu because it‚Äôs the original Kanto world and original 151 Dex, but the majority of the gameplay isn‚Äôt the traditional turn-based combat and I wonder if he would tire of the constant catching mechanic? 

I‚Äôve not played Violet/Scarlett (yet) myself so I‚Äôm not sure how it actually is as a game.

Pok√©mon Arceus was immense, but I feel I enjoyed it more because it was so different to the rest of the franchise? 

I enjoyed Sword/Shield and Diamond/Pearl but maybe I just don‚Äôt have the same nostalgia for them as other games

(I want to keep it as a vaguely traditional Pok√©mon, so not including Snap, DX, Mystery Dungeon - for now! If he likes the franchise, maybe in the future!)

pokemon,5 ideas to make 5 bad Pok√©mon better,"Just something that came to mind. Basically I took a bad Pok√©mon, gave it something that I think could make it decent at the very least and put it here. Enjoy:

**Spinda**  
New Move  
Dismaying Dance:  
Reduces all stats of all Pok√©mon on the field by 1 stage. Works well with contrary.

**Delibird**  
New Move  
Frozen Coal:  
Can cause 1 of 4 actions to occur. Here are the effects and the chance they will happen:  
Damage opponent with equivalent of 100 Base Power Special Ice move used by Delibird: 40%  
Freeze all Opponent‚Äôs Pok√©mon: 30%  
All Opponent‚Äôs current Pok√©mon cannot use status moves for 5 turns: 20%  
All Opponent‚Äôs current Pok√©mon only deals 1 damage with damaging moves: 10%

**Unown**  
New Ability:  
Power of the Unown.   
Upon coming in, Unown gets a 1 stage boost to its stats for every Unown in your party that is not fainted. So 1 Unowns means +1 everything and 6 means +6 everything.

**Castform**  
Upgraded Ability   
Forecast:  
If Castform sets up a weather condition with moves like Rain dance or Sunny day, the weather effect is permanent unless the weather is changed by another source. Essentially, it works like Gen 5 weather.

Regigigas:  
New Move  
**Golem Maker**:   
Regigigas gives up 25% of its max HP to create a golem using the environment that the battle is currently in. The golem basically works like a substitute but it‚Äôs typing will be dependant on what environment it was created with (the environment will depend on the terrain and weather with weather taking priority) and that golem will also have a unique property depending on the environment as well.

Here‚Äôs the types each of their properties:

Normal (Plain arena): Doubles the Attack of Regigigas while it is out.  
Electric (Electric Terrain): Doubles the Speed of Regigigas while it is out.   
Water (Rain): Has double the HP of the other golems.   
Ground (Sandstorm): Has double the physical Defense of the other golems.   
Psychic (Psychic Terrain): Has double the Special Defense of the other golems.   
Fire (Sun): If the golem is destroyed by a physical move, the opponent is burned.  
Ice (Hail): If the golem is destroyed by a special move, their speed is dropped by 2 stages (or if frostbite comes back, inflict that to them).  
Grass (Grassy Terrain): Heals Regigigas for 1/16 of its max HP each turn.  
Fairy (Misty Terrain): Heals a random party member of status each turn.",pokemon,pos

FIFA,"Moneyball fifa, the cheap Ronaldo, Gullit, Vieira, Lucio, wc capdevilla","Sorry for the delay in the second iteration of this, I had to spend time testing players and ultimately coming to the conclusion that I was wrong about the most broken player in the game.

The cheap R9 (prime/mid) we need to look at characteristics , a 6 foot strong fast player with 5 starved and skills is hard to replicate. I play a lot of friendlier simply to use this monster and after extensively using the ‚Äúcheap option‚Äù not only do I think he compares to r9 I actually prefer him.

I think everyone knows of whom I speak of, the player that made me a pariah in the comments of the last edition of this mbappe. My FB Ramos fooled me into thinking he was not an outstanding striker and was only elite in wide positions. I was wrong, he‚Äôs broken. He‚Äôs  not cheap but he‚Äôs cheap for what you get. He feels faster and smoother than r9 plus has the same physical power. He‚Äôs glitchier has better animations. R9 has a more powerful shot but it‚Äôs not massively worse. The wf like Hugo Sanchez Toty is a lie it might as well be 5 star.

Other options stoichkov (feels like r9 without skills and wf), if madvidi, Toty Hugo sanchez, ww lacazette, Richarlson

Gullit(mid/prime): for this you can say no one compares, a presence like no other, however we can go close, wc toure ironically is a cheaper alternative. Although he‚Äôs not my choice, we need big midfielders with pace, and all round ability. The best was fb pogba who is definitely the cheap toure if not gullit, I believe he‚Äôs better than Toure in game especially going forward (I like skills so that‚Äôs probably why) he‚Äôs not as good defensively. In fact he has better stats and a unique build animations that toure lacks. Note he‚Äôs worse than Gullit in both aspects but is a better dribbler.

Other players that compare to gullit seem to be either hard to link or expired sbcs, ww chielini or else bale or closest fs de ket.

But here is my choice and he really is a bargain Perisic either wc or oop is Gullit light he‚Äôs tremendous even now and he‚Äôs dirt cheap. Big in game same weakfoot and skills, and is box to box. Also good links.

Cheap Vieira: obvious choice is fs Thuram a clone bar work rates, another expired sbc hm fofana also compares. The oop is also great but I don‚Äôt like choosing an expired sbc. My choice here is ptg zakaria who is slightly worse than Thuram.

Cheap Lucio: we could say the base, he‚Äôs affordable now. Apart from that there are actually a lot of bargains, gold vvd and hm bremer are two. However vvd seems to lack the pace and bremer the physical aspect of Lucio. Lucio physicality is a consequence of his body type. A player who shares it is tomori, his 86 with anchor looks like Lucio with shadow, he lacks comparatively in reactions and def awareness so is not as good, but I pref him over smalling or bremer or cordoba or kalulu. The ww is a minimal upgrade in the 86.

For the wc the cheap alternative apart from the base is a toss up between mid Alberto or more comparatively cent kimpembe. The latter is very comparable ig.

Cheap wc capdevilla: slightly worse clone el Miranda not much to say here",pokemon,pos

To make the game's plot work, it seems like they gimped their most powerful god, and it all feels utterly disappointing.

Some notes I had about Mewthree‚Äôs design:

- No eyes, and a hole in its forehead showing off its immense psychic power 
- Fusion between Mega Mewtwo X and Y
- Mewtwo X‚Äôs bandages would be altered to look like chains symbolizing Team Rocket‚Äôs control over it
- Color scheme would be grey, black and a tiny bit of blue/purple 

In the other timeline, another Evil Team (dunno who it would be) manage to capture Deoxys and create clones of it, called Paradoxys.

Some notes I had about Paradoxys‚Äôs design:

- No eyes, instead it had a gold 4-pointed star on its forehead
- Mixture of all of the Deoxys forms

Even washing dishes, my sim will finish their meal and go upstairs to wash their dish in the FARTHEST bathroom sink. And to make it even worse, when my sim goes to cook a meal he always goes to the third floor to use a counter up there! Even though there's literally five counters open in the kitchen! I got tired of it one time that I actually locked the kitchen door and he got upset and put the unprepared meal down because the path to the third floor counter was blocked! Like why?!?!

pokemon,Kartana might be the most terrifying thing coming to Pokemon SV.,"I had some thought about this after looking at Kartana again. Kartana's highest stat is it's 181 atk stat, with a 4x weakness to fire and really bad bulk, but makes up for it in speed, also has the ability \[Beast Boost\] which increases it's highest stat after i knocks out a pokemon (Most likely by OKO). So that got me thinking, how strong would a Terra-Rock Kartana be? Loses its weakness to fire and gains more with it, but how would you stop it besides bringing something like a Dragapult or a sash to try and gain a speed boost. With it having a 4x weakness to fighting afterward almost completely taken care of by it having 131 DEF and giving it an assault vest would help it greatly. BUT EVEN THEN, thats without EV and IV training. Thankfully, this pokemon will  not be able to see the light of competitive SV content (hopefully forever), but what are your thoughts?

FIFA,Xavi's Barcelona Custom Tactics,"All the credit goes to a video that's linked in comments.

Trying this out and finding great joy and success with this system. It's quite impressive how closely these tactics mimic Xavi's Barcelona of late.

You start off in a 3-4-2-1 which transitions from 3-2-2-3 in attack to 4-4-2 in defence.

The ""box"" midfield creates endless options, and has made it so easy to find space through even the most congested defences. You will also always have a wide man available as an outlet to relieve pressure while in possession. Lastly, the quick transition to a 4-4-2 in defence is very apparent and extremely solid for me so far!

I think the key players here are your wide mids and the 2 CFs that function like advanced interiors.

I use Jairzinho as my attacking wide mid (similar to what Raphinha / Dembele do) and Capdevilla as my more defensive LM (charges up and down the pitch like Balde / Alba).

For my 2 CFs, I went with the best versions of Gavi and Pedri. Their tight dribbling, high work rates and excellent passing means that they are always providing defensive cover as well as creating attacking opportunities.

Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try something a bit different!

Here's my team for reference - [https://photos.app.goo.gl/ohahcDGispoT1Gje7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ohahcDGispoT1Gje7)

My favorite pokemon game is platinum and i really want to do a challenge in it. I already did a bug only challenge, but nuzlockes i think go too far for my taste.

Now this resulted in a really big choice and i dont think that is very hard. Could it be possible to try a challenge where if a pokemon on bulbapedia can be found in less than 4 places is""rare""?
