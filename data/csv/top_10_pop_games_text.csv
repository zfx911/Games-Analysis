pokemon,OneWhoGetsBread,the PokemonTogether campaign,"So several days ago, The Pokemon Company put out a campaign in celebration of Pokemon Day approaching where fans could submit a short story about  favourite memories related to Pokemon and there is a chance of your submission of the photo will appear on the Pokemon Day Mosaic if you tag TPCI and use the hashtag on social media.

If you haven't yet, please do so soon! But if you have, what fond memory from the Pokemon series have you experienced? 


Mine would be how the Pokemon series as a whole inspired me to pursue Biology wayy back in elementary / middle school. I loved outdoors activities as well as studying different kinds of animals (specifically birds), and in addition, my family lived right next to these untouched woods so there would always be so many kinds of birds for younger me to watch and learn about!

Currently as of writing this, I am in my 2nd yr of college for a Biotech Major and nothing beats opening a Pokemon game and just exploring the region's different ecosystems! Scarlet and Violet's open world style really brought a sense of exploration to me due to how the Pokemon felt really connected to certain habitats just like in real life......like all those Veluza in the Lake that chase you lol

Please share your fond memories of Pokemon or a fun experience youve had related to pokemon below! I'd love to hear about them !!",0,6,2023-02-22 21:08:56,2023,2

DestinyTheGame,Maiburger,Strand Hunter Gainer uses up your dodge,"So I just saw the new strand Dev Insight and realized that at 5:55 where the Hunter activates his flip to stun the unstoppable he uses up his dodge cooldown. So it wont be able to be activated in as quick of a succession  as Shatter Dive
That means eager edge skating probably won't work. It also doesn't work with the radiant dodge on solar (or Phoenix Dive or Trappers Ambush, etc.) and I am guessing that you can only activate it in the air opposed to only on the ground. The mobility would probably have been to much. Bungie knew that.
Still pretty cool Idea.

Eldenring,TrefoilTang,Opinion: I do not like the weapon upgrade system in ER,"After 400 hours in ER, more and more I feel like the smithing stone upgrading system in ER makes the game less fun overall.

I think the tier-based Titanite Shard upgrading system in Dark Souls works fine, but it's partially due to the fact that there are the weapon options available to each build are very limited in every stage of the game. DS is also quite linear compared to ER. 

In Elden Ring, however, you constantly get new weapons thrown at you. ER encourages exploration, so you are always getting new options you want to try out. However, since upgrade materials are limited in each tier, and it's going to take a long time before you get unlimited access to them, you have to take a lot of risks before investing your materials in one weapon.

So, you get a bunch of new toys as a reward for explorations, but usually, you are only able to upgrade one of them to its full potential, no matter how much you explore, unless you are willing to enter an area you are under-leveled in.

**This, in my opinion, goes against the fundamental design philosophies of Elden Ring.** 

Especially for new players in the early game who don't know how to find/farm upgrade materials efficiently. It is easy for them to mess up the upgrades, ending up making the game harder for themselves. 

I think Fromsoft should take a different approach to weapon upgrades or add some extra features to make trying different playstyles in early games more viable. 

For example, maybe add a consumable similar to the Bonfire Ascetics in DS2 that respawn all the items in a dungeon while making everything harder.",40,0,2023-02-22 21:16:35,2023,2

pokemongo,Kxletx,"Thanks for Hoenn, Niantic.","I gotta say at the beginning - i consider this community often demanding and wanting everything to be easy and free. I kinda gotta say - sorry for sometimes engaging into mean conversations tho.  
When we lost some of the covid privileges - i used to say ""this game is about walking"".  
When then screwed rular players, i was indifferent - i moved to big city to play pokemon.  
But **Niantic recently confirmed that only some pokemon will have boosted shiny ratio at global event**.

Which pieced ME of. Me, sole Nantic defender.

Hoenn is my favaourite generation, and since Kanto Tour i was waiting for this day.

When they made in-person event, i was kinda worried about global event form. I'm European (middle-European as well), so obviously i couldn't afford a trip to the other side of the globe. I'm also alcoholic, so it would not be good idea to go to Las Vegas even if i had all the money in the world. They did forget Europe and Asia for this event.

And now they are gatekeeping it.

I can't even express how upset i am. My only fault was not earning 5k$+ to travel to US.

I'm done. Screw you, Niantic. Sorry, my brothers, for ignoring the fact, that they are ruining this game for you, your way. Now they did it my way, and i humbly apologize.",1,3,2023-02-22 21:17:17,2023,2

DestinyTheGame,asylumprophet,I appreciate how activity dialogue has been tied to quest progression the past few seasons,"I'm one of those people who waits a few/several weeks before doing the seasonal stories, so I can play through at my own pace. Back during Chosen, the dialogue was tied to weekly resets. Even avoiding spoilers for 3/4 of the season, my first battlegrounds ended with ""good thing our Cabal alliance survived Zavala's assassination attempt, huh?"" And that had enough of an impact that I still think about it, apparently.

But then starting with season of the Splicer, the conversations you hear in-game only changed when you reach certain points in the seasonal quest. The story and everyone in it started following your pace (with the exception of the taken stuff in the tower, at least). 

Even with this year's closing event- I was still a few weeks behind when the final mission dropped. When I landed in the tower, everything was exactly where I left it. The dialogue in heists reflected where I was in the story. It made it all the more impactful when the world only changed for me when I did the mission myself.

Small QOL thing, but I want to give that positive feedback because it really improved the experience for me- both not feeling as rushed to play and getting to experience the story progression.",22,514,2023-02-22 21:17:29,2023,2

The seasons system has me confused and has turned me off from the game slightly because of it. I've seen they have removed many playable areas from the game so I assume the main story of the game isn't playable anymore nor are the first two DLC.

SO MAD 

the worst part is, i didnt get any pop-up saying there was a conflict between my cloud and local save, it just let me boot up no problem. if i could have been more careful it would be easier to swallow, but there was no way for me to know my save wasn't updated!! i checked my cloud save files to see if there was a backup but theres only one file, from me opening the game just now.

pokemongo,ForeverBackground737,have you tried not hating on niantic by default,"After browsing this sub for a while, I noticed there's a breed of people that just hate on niantic for the sake of hating. 
I've been in countless arguments with them, trying to show them the other side of a situation, but that usually just ends in more hate and being called a ""bootlicker"" 

There's a common trend going on that niantic gets hate no matter what. Niantic bad is a default response. 

The latest one is the masterwork research. You didn't bother to look up the task, and now you are hurt because it takes more effort than catching 5 pokemon and sending 10 gifts, making niantic a bad greedy company. 

The other one is the possibility of a daily remote raid limit. 
We don't even know what it is or means yet, but niantic is already a bad company. Unless they set it to an abysmal low amount, you most likely won't notice it at all unless you're a whale doing a lot of remote raids every single day. Even if they set it to a max of 5 raids, the large majority wouldn't be spending 5$ a day raiding. You can still do ~35remote raids in the 1-week legendary rotation. 

There's many more situations where this breed of people just throws a tantrum. 

Niantic does mess up from time to time. They do make mistakes its undeniable. But I personally feel that part of this community just yells outrage for the sake of being angry for no good reason. 


This post most likely won't go far, most of the people who think this way are in the new posts section, and I expect hate to come my way for being a ""bootlicker""  but I still wanted to get this of my chest. 

Try to channel your anger for when niantic deserves it and stop being upset about things you don't understand. Do some research and ask why before you get angry at least.

They tell me that I should buy witch queen dlc since its 20 eur for deluxe edition right now on steam but i want someone else's opinion should i do so since they already cashed in on all expansions and i dont know yet if i want to commit so much.

From all the videos i saw everyone says that story and everything in witch queen is best there is to offer so far but i dont know if i should get it or not considering season (and expansion) end in less than a week",3,5,2023-02-21 06:30:00,2023,2

Day 0,179: IT'S MAREEP!! 

&amp;#x200B;

[Art by  SeviYummy on Deviantart](https://preview.redd.it/zq17kefmkhja1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c3de99e03a78a70a9c55059c537d806868935f90)

Mareep is one of the first Electric types to really stick out to me growing up and the affection has stuck. I've never really *used* this line so there isn't really anything sentimental when it comes to my ramblings today; But I mean... COME ON! IT'S A SHEEP! WHO HATES SHEEPS???

It's so fluffy and can shock you, what's there to dislike?!

AND IT HAS AN ADORABLY PINK COTTEN CANDY SHINY??? PERFECTION!

But no really Mareep is one of those simple designs that's ""Just a sheep"" but like. It works! And it does it well! Even if it's a bit boring I still love it so much. 

Definitely a B Pokemon!

Day 0,180: Flaaffy!

&amp;#x200B;

[ARt by  winterando on instagram!](https://preview.redd.it/17g98gmvkhja1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=27608a44a95e2a0a9e28fc853def501ce80eded6)

Now sadly I love Mareep but I kind of fall off the line the more it evolves -- which might be why I've never willingly used this line. There isn't really inherently nothing *wrong* with Flaaffy; It adds more to a design that already worked but like..

Why is it pink?? Why the sudden color change literally midway through it's evolution??

It'd make sense if Ampharos was pink but it goes back to yellow so why did Flaaffy have a sudden pink phase? It bugs me *a lot.*

Flaaffy's shiny also SUCKS. The little orb at the end of its tail turns more green than blue and it's such a minor change that I just -- ughajdkf;jsakldf GRRR

But yeah. Flaaffy is cute by itself and if it was the first Pokemon to this line I'm sure I'd have more positive things to say but it's.. a weird awkward middle stage but not for the reason it *should* be. 

C-

Day 0,181: Ampharos!

&amp;#x200B;

[Art by Mia Blažeković on Art Station!  ](https://preview.redd.it/67o79lb9lhja1.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac970893393e72647d3117343855df2eb15179b6)

Ugggggh I remember the whole deal with Jasmine's gym and having to get medicine for her Ampharos -- like fukcing -- I don't know. GO GET YOUR OWN MEDICINE WHY DID I HAVE TO DO IT???

I also don't really like this end line overall. It's cute, I'll give it that but I really dislike how Mareep evolved into a Pokemon that ends up on two feet. Why does Pokemon make adorable four legged Pokemon bipedal??? LIKE WHY

It's shiny turns a bright pink, which I think is funny since it's following the color that Flaafy was aiming for. I don't know if it's intentional (Probably not) but it's a nice nod I guess.

I do like how it gets cute little space-bun looking horns. The design *works* I guess it's just.. I don't know. It's not as good as I wish Mareep *could have* been.

C-

Mega Ampharos: **C-** *Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline.*

But yeah Mega Ampharos -- It adds more than just hair but it sure is the most noticeable feature LMAO. I didn't even notice the big cloud like tail at first until I just looked at the image. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still behind on my daily ramblings, I think! Hopefully not by much! But I hope you enjoyed none the less!!

See ya tomorrow!

Eldenring,vallummumbles,"i don't like fighting Melania, what about you?","TLDR: waterfowl is annoying and ruins the fight for me, what do you think?

Sorry just a hybrid rant and also curiosity. I'm gonna be real, I don't actually enjoy Melania's fight that much. And it's for one reason and one reason only: Waterfowl.

So yeah I know there try and true methods to dodging it, getting away from it etc. But man I hate it. It breaks up the whole fight imo, everytime I run up to her I have that fear she'll jump and just kill me no matter how well I've done thus far.

Like for example, I just got done steam rolling her with a buddy of mine, so I thought I'd wrap up her first stage with melee so I didn't waste FP and then BOOM waterfowl, dead. There's not really a way to consistently avoid it if your right on top of her when she jumps. So the entire fight I'm just avoiding her and occasionally jump attacking her.

This is the exact opposite of why I love the chaos of fighting Godfrey and Radagon. You can stay aggressive and don't have to worry about a malarkey attack that you physically can't roll through. 

Kinda blows too cause beyond waterfowl her attacks are pretty cool and she'd be difficult without it. 

Either way, what do you guys feel? How do you feel about her boss fight? Love it? Hate it? Do I just need to get good?",10,0,2023-02-21 06:48:21,2023,2

DestinyTheGame,TJ_Dot,I still think Crafting should join Collections and overtake the Vault. But Enhancing weapons seems like a great way to begin the path.,"The Battle of Crafted v Random Rolls has led to less weapons being craftable and the ability to slap on the Crafted specialties to RR weapons. This feels like a regression for Crafting's true potential however by going the way of fearing it rather than embracing it. 

In the Past, I've argued that in the likely inevitable future that Power Levels die and Difficulty selection becomes the norm, Collections could ""simply"" become a Crafting hotspot for all items. There'd be no power to worry about generating things below where you're at, and Crafting has already justified pre-determined item creation. Weapon stats would be saved per weapon and not per copy of the weapon. Perk and cosmetic combinations would have a pre-selection of what was last set so deletion and generation is practically identical to the Vault experience.  The single divide between this and RR items however lies in how items are unlocked and how (least for guns since Armor crafting doesn't exist and is a whole other discussion on how that'd even work) perks would be unlocked.

Right now you can just power level a weapon to 20 probably at Shuro Chi or something over and done with in an hour if you commit hard enough, buy the perks, and boom, gun over and done with.

This new Enhancing feature and the could offer a different linear progression that isn't just Kills. Where Enhanced weapons through more varied challenges or other tasks/material costs can progress through all the perks like a skill tree (have to unlock everything along the way), culminating in going back through for the enhanced perks.

It would need to be a path that actually took some time instead of just having material stock and a kill farm. That way, you can very easily just get a suitable roll you want instead. 

I don't know the feasibility of saving a preset roll in Collections for everything, but I would want to believe it isn't much compared to 600 potentially random entities. If the Vault had to die for this, I would think it could be worth it. Though now I realize that would make keeping RRs kinda hard. 

But yeah, those be my thoughts after hearing more about enhancing.",7,0,2023-02-21 04:53:04,2023,2

This is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, ""newbie"" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.

Well written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just don’t like. This includes “so and so boss is stupid and too difficult.”

If you are interested in the game but don’t own it yet, please don’t post “should I buy this game?” or “Is this game worth it?”. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you haven’t, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And that’s okay!

---

Here we are with another update, this time coming from our World Systems team and focusing on the changes coming not only to Vanguard Ops, but also Nightfalls, raids, dungeons, and more.



Lightfall is almost upon us, and a lot is changing in the game. Proof of that is the [buildcrafting](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/buildcrafting), [abilities](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/ability-changes-lightfall-d2), [weapon sandbox](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/s20-weapon-tuning-preview) and [weapon crafting](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/enhancing-weapon-crafting) articles from the last few weeks. But we also wanted to share some details on how we're improving several activities in order to better reward your efforts, especially when you face the hardest content Destiny 2 has to offer.


##Everything Hurts Now


How much? Well, that depends on you. Philosophically, we are attempting to bring the difficulty levels of Legend closer to the popular Legendary Campaign experience, and the Master experience closer to day-one raids. At the same time, any high-difficulty ritual content is designed to last many playthroughs over multiple Seasons, so we’re making some changes week-over-week and Season-over-Season to keep them fresh. Here's a breakdown of the changes coming to several high-difficulty activities starting with Lightfall.


####The Basics of High-Difficulty Activities


* Adept difficulty is being removed.
* Hero difficulty will now be available at 1750 Power (the Soft Cap).
* Legend and Master difficulties can be entered once you hit 1800 (the Power Cap).

   * Activity levels for Season 20:

      * Hero: 1770
      * Legend: 1830
      * Master: 1840
* We are implementing Power level disadvantages to provide a better challenge curve:

   * Hero: -5 Power levels.
   * Legend: -15 Power levels.
   * Master: -20 Power levels.
   * Grandmaster Nightfalls: -25 Power levels.
* Match Game is being removed.

   * Mismatched shields will now take 50% less damage across the whole game.
* Burns in high-level activities will be split into **Surges** and **Threats**.

   * **Surges** increase your outgoing damage:

      * Surges increase elemental damage dealt by 25%.
      * Surges for high-difficulty activities change every Season based around featured damage types.

         * Featured Surge for Season of Defiance will be Strand.
         * Weekly rotating Surges will be Solar and Void.
   * **Threats** increase elemental damage coming from enemies by 25%.
* High-level activities now also feature **Overcharged weapons.**

   * An Overcharged weapon deals 25% more damage.
   * Kinetic damage is also increased by 25% if using a Surging subclass.
   * Overcharged weapons can come from several sources. Currently:

      * Weapons set per activity.
      * Weapons featured as Champion counters on the Seasonal Artifact.
   * **Overcharges and Surges do not stack.**

      * Overcharged weapons do not get extra damage if they are also Surging.
      * You only need one for a given damage source.
* Combatants are harder to stagger, and their health has been increased across the board.

   * This is to compensate for Surge and Overcharge.
   * The effect is strongest on powerful enemies and weakest on rank-and-file.
####What is not changing


* Equipment is still locked on Legend and Master difficulties, as well as Grandmaster Nightfalls.
* Matchmaking is still available on Hero, but closed on Legend, Master, and Grandmaster Nightfalls.
* Modifiers that affect enemy types (Fire Pit, for example) or fireteam coordination (Chaff, Togetherness, etc.).
* Champion availability remains the same.
* Grandmaster Nightfall revive limitations, wipe conditions and schedule stay the same.
##The High Scores Strike Back


Ritual activities are at the core of the Destiny 2 experience. That's why we have plans to improve on these familiar playlists that we all cherish so much. Today, we are focusing on the Vanguard Ops playlist.


####Strike Refreshes


* Lake of Shadows and Arms Dealer are being updated with new enemies, new encounters, new mechanics and new objectives.

   * Expect them to be much tougher than before... and less Sparrow-friendly.
* We are working on adjusting other strikes, like Exodus Crash and The Inverted Spire.

   * Their presence on the Vanguard Ops playlist has been dramatically reduced.
   * They won't be part of the Nightfall rotations until brought to parity.
####Vanguard Ops Playlist


* PsiOps Battlegrounds and Heist Battlegrounds will become part of the Vanguard Ops playlist.
* The playlist is now Power Disabled, like Gambit and Crucible.

   * This means you won't have a damage advantage over enemies, or them upon you, no matter your Power level.
* Daily rotators and weekly Singes have been removed and replaced with:

   * One random weekly Surge.
   * One random daily Threat.
   * One daily random modifier from our ""best of"" collection, including Subtle Foes, Lightning Crystals, and more.
####Vanguard Ops Scoring


* We are adding scoring to the Vanguard Ops playlist.

   * Just like in Nightfalls, you earn points for killing enemies and other events (precision kills, picking up orbs, reviving teammates), with a multiplier based on the specific strike.
* The higher your score, the larger your Vanguard Rank multiplier will be.

   * You get a 1x multiplier on Vanguard Rank earn for getting below 30,000 points.
   * The multiplier increases every 5,000 points after the initial 30,000.
   * The largest multiplier available is 7x for getting over 250,000.
* This applies to all Vanguard modes, including Nightfalls.
####Vanguard Challenges


The Vanguard screen challenges are being adjusted to reflect these changes. To complete the weekly Vanguard challenge, you will now need to:



* Complete Vanguard activities with a Surging subclass.

   * It can be either the Seasonal Surges for Nightfalls or the Vanguard Ops weekly Surge.
* Complete five activities.

   * You get increased progress for harder difficulties.

      * A single Grandmaster Nightfall completes this challenge.
##Nightfalls are Dark and Full of Terrors


Nightfalls are getting a tad more challenging, to the point where you'll have to think twice before jumping into one without a proper build. Take one thing into consideration: once you reach the maximum effectiveness level, how high your Power level is won't make a difference. Or how many extra Artifact levels you have, for that matter.



* Battlegrounds will slowly become part of the Nightfall playlist, starting with Mars Heist Battleground.

   * We will include others in following Seasons.
* Two Surges available.
* Threats dependent on the featured Nightfall.
* One featured Overcharged weapon.
* Combatants are harder to stagger and have more health.
* Nightfall activity levels for Season 20:

   * Hero: 1770
   * Legend: 1830
   * Master: 1840
   * Grandmaster: 1840
* Power delta disadvantages:

   * Hero: -5 Power levels
   * Legend: -15 Power levels
   * Master: -20 Power levels
   * Grandmaster: -25 Power levels
* Maximum effectiveness targets:

   * Hero: 1765
   * Legend: 1815
   * Master: 1820
   * Grandmaster: 1815
* The Nightfall weekly challenge now requires you to attain 200,000 points across multiple Nightfall runs, rather than 100,000 points in a single run.
##Raids and Dungeons Get the Power Delta Treatment


We know the Master difficulty experience for dungeons and raids had its flaws, so we are making a few changes that those looking for a challenge should certainly find appealing.



* One Overcharged weapon.
* Two Surges.
* No Threat modifier.
* Combatants don't have increased health or increased stagger resistance.

   * We want to bring them into line with other Master experiences without the need to buildcraft toward Surges or Overcharges.
##No Activity Left Behind


We are aware that Lost Sectors and weekly campaign missions are not as rewarding as the community would like. We actually agree. Same thing with Dares of Eternity and The Wellspring. The passion around them is appreciated and your feedback is always clear: they should be a bit more challenging. Here are our plans to improve not only them, but other activities, too.


####Lost Sectors


* One Overcharged weapon.
* Two Surges.
* Threats depend on the featured Lost Sector.
* Combatants are harder to stagger and have more health.
* Available in Legend and Master difficulties.

   * Lost Sectors feature +20 combat delta (rather than -15 or -20).
* We will be monitoring completion rates and times during Season 20 to see if Exotic engram drop rates need to be adjusted.

   * There will be additional paths to acquiring Lightfall Exotic armors that you can discover on 2/28.
####Nightmare, Empire Hunts, and Campaign Weekly Missions


* One Overcharged weapon.
* Two weekly rotating Surges.
* Threats depend on the type of activity.

VALORANT,Shirx0,Idea on How to Get Old Battlepass Items and a Smal Rework on the Shop,"As someone who really likes the cosmetics in this game, I was talking about this topic the other day with some friends and that got me thinking about ways to improve this system.

Firstly I would like to talk about a new way to get old battlepass items with boxes: you would get a chance to get these boxes only by playing certain game modes: comp, unraked, switfplay and spike rush (the last two would have a lower chance to drop them). I think weekly missions should give you a box too once you complete all of them. Note that this boxes wouldn't be purshable.

Different items should have different rarities, starting with the hardest to get:

* any bp knife
* other bp gun skins  buddys / cards / titles / sprays
* (maybe) content from previous free batlepasses (champions bp, arcane bp, etc)
* free items from normal battlepass

Because the game has a lot of bp items I think this system would be fair for players who bought the last bpasses since it's hard to get the one item you want and buying the batlepass would be a way to guarantee all the items that you want.

There's a lot of other cosmetics from previous collections that we can't buy anymore. Because of that I think that we should be able to get them in store too. Their store would be similar to the weapon store but I think we should have just a slot for every type of item: 1 for sprays, 1 for cards, 1 for titles and 1 for buddys.

Lastly I would like to give another (unlikely to happen tbh) suggestion: a slot where you can choose the weapon type you want (and change it when you want). This way if you want a specific skin for vandal (for example) the chances you have to get it are higher.

Sorry for the long text and for any english mistakes I've made. I know this suggestions are unlikely to come to the game but I want to see your opinions on this topic. Do you think that the box system is fair to those who bought the old battlepasses? How would you implement this into the game? Do you think Riot would ever make this cosmetics comeback?

Minecraft,Dantem111,Any way to fix this issue??,"So my friend bought realm on minecraft bedrock so that our survival world can be played and accessed anytime. Today he said he was ""texting"" something, then suddenly he dmed me saying he messed up something; when i checked the realm, it appears to be offline and no one can join the realm. Later on, he managed to join the realm but when the world loaded up, it wasn't our survival. Instead it was a random generated world.

Is the survival world corrupted? I'm so confused rn.

Also, will anyone know what he did to cause such thing to happen?

Any help will be appreciated, thanks.

So far I've been lucky enough to have a recent enough back up I can copy over from cloud storage and mostly recover, but I really would like to know if there is way to fix it happening at all.

I thought it was because my save glitched the first time - I had been trying to quit and the game hung while saving and I had to force close the game.  But the most recent time it happened the save had worked fine and I quit the game normally.  So now I don't know.

Eldenring,Alweense,Looking for some tips and reccomendations for my build. I'm level 165 and don't exactly know how I should spread my stats.,"So up until now (I've just defeated Morgott), I've spread my stats evenly (I had like about 32 for each stat) but everyone says that's a terrible idea so I'm going to change it, but don't quite know how I should spread them. I am a pretty high level for my current progress I know, that's because I used to farm quite a lot but I don't anymore, I think I should be strong enough.

Note that my main weapon is the Sword of Night and Flame so I am mostly interested in intelligence/faith, for its abilities. But I don't want to leave strength and dexterity dumped because they're important for my melee attacks. 

Also I want enough vigor to be able to carry me through the Mountaintops of the Giants and Crumbling Farum Azula, which are the areas I have yet to explore. Not too sure how much mind and endurance I need though. And as for arcane I don't really care.

**WEAPONS**

\- Sword of Night and Flame +10. Right.

\- Carian Knight's shield +14. Left.

\-Prince of Death's Staff +25: Ancient Death Rancor, Rock Sling. Right.

\-Golden Order Seal +5: Golden Vow. Left.

**ARMOR**

Currently using the raging wolf set mostly for the looks but if there's a good looking set with good stats then let me know.

**TALISMANS**

\- Radagon's icon (quicker spell casting).

\- Assassin's crimson dagger (restores health on critical hits).

\- Two fingers heirloom (increases faith).

\- Golden scarab (increases runes obtained).

P.S: my starting class was wretch so I can't have any stat below 10.

The only difference I can think of is that sleep-moves make no damage, while freezing moves are strictly damaging moves with a a slight possibility to make the enemy pokemon freeze, but this isn't related to the staus itself. 
Oh, and you can use Sleep Talk while sleeping and Scald while you're frozen, but they are so rare that you couldn't even experience that in hundreds of in game hours.

VALORANT,eskeletsh,Are they cheaters or smurfs?,"I hangout at streams like Aceu Tenz Shroud Hiko almost every day since Valorant Beta. I try to learn from them as much as I can. But the last couple of weeks I see people insanely good at ranked. Especially at gold/plat, since I'm ranked around that area now. I used to be diamond 3 so I'm not that bad at the game. But some players predict perfectly where I am in site and use all mollies and nades at the spot I am in. When I change positioning, they change also. Let's ignore that. 
People sometimes prefire. Understandable.
But imagine faking that im going to peek an angle and they start firing at that time. I stop before the peek just as a test. Coincidence? Maybe!
What about when my own teammates (while im solo queueing) stack alwayas every defensive round exactly the site my enemy team is pushing. Yup I sus people on my team as well.

1. His portal should be quieter. I think a quieter teleport sound would make him op. But the range from which his portal can be heard should definitely be reduced by a lot.
2. His teleport itself should be faster. Not as fast as jetts dash, but there should atleast be a chance for yoru to get away mid fight.

This way there will be equal chance for both of the teams to try. I got matched vs 6 x Flawless guys this week on my 2nd win trying to get 5 wins for the sword. Not everyone can go flawless on top of that people lose hope and motivation to carry on playing trials when they match up against very high skilled players. It just get annoying.

Or If they already went flawless give them another passage where they can match make passage vs passage for example

Once they got flawless they can buy Passage of Osiris (7 wins give 2 rewards req: been flawless on the same week)

and Passage of mercy players can match make with passage of mercy players

I dont have any other good solution I am just an average player these were my 2cents

&amp;#x200B;

So, Mondstadt's towers and Statue of the Sevens would be mint green.

Liyue would have light brown devices.

Inazuma would have purple devices.

Sumeru could have light green devices.

Fontaine could use the original blue.

Natlan could have light orange devices.

And Snezhnaya could use light blue devices.

DestinyTheGame,Itsyaboifam,"Season of the chosen has really good loot. That is a complete W Bungie... But the loot distribution, overall this season NEEDS TO CHANGE","***1. Core playlist activities***

These need to have increased drops... like a lot

With U adding new weapons to these playlist, I feel like the whole, shared loot pool can be put to rest on vanguard and crucible, leaving it for random drops and the gunsmith

U know those crucible and gambit engrams? Maybe they drop... U know... Crucible and gambit loot respectively.

***2. Umbral focusing***

I have done... A LOT of battlegrounds, I no joke have unlocked most acessible thriumps related to the activity, and have a lot of the weapon rolls (not all thou)

I can safely say, U guys went overboard with how hard it is to focus

Tier 1 costing 1 charge is alright, works fine

Tier 2 costing 3 charges is IMO where the issue lies, When we have a fully working hammer, we will be abble to slot a medalion that nets us 2 charges, and a rune that adds a chance at a third... This basically means we are, by doing one battleground, not even guaranteed to get the ammount of charges for a 50% chace to gain the weapon we want to droo

Compare this to season of the hunt (chosen&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hunt), and there we could guarantee a drop of the weapon we wanted with little to no work

Those are polar oposites ways of loot delivery, and IMO Umbrals need to be more acessible in their charge delivery

*Tier 1 should keep their cost at 1*
*Tier 2 should cost 2 charges*
*Tier 3 should cost 3*

This way U are guaranteed a tier 2 focusing at the end of a battleground (2 charges), provided U have the right medalion (double charge), and U have a chance at a tier 3 focused umbral (3 charges) provided u have the right upgrades (double charge+rune), and get lucky

***3. Tier 3 focusing lockout***

This one IMO deserves a topic for it own

Bungie... pls, dont ever lock out focusing umbral to 3 a week... better, dont ever lock them out

I WANT to get those armor drops to start getting new gear, preparing for my current gears sunset timer...

Plas dont make me locked out to 3 when I can farm for more... Even better than that, make them more acessible with charges, and dont lock them

They basically offer to great advantage over tier 2 (weapons wise), but are Necessary addtions to armor grinding with sunsetting in the game... SO PLEASE

Minecraft,kamikazi21358,Minecraft Java technical issues [Singleplayer],"I can’t figure out why it’s happening, I’m seeing if anyone else has this or knows what’s going on.

[Minecraft Java 1.16.5, forge + optifine, nothing else].

My survival world on Java runs fine for like 5-10 minutes.  But after that, the world randomly seems to freeze, however I’m still able to move — I can break blocks and open inventory and move, however all blocks stop dropping when broken, all items on ground can’t be picked up, and chests cannot be open.  It either happens for a while or is indefinite, and exiting the world shows “Saving world”, but takes literally 10-20 minutes to save.  Exiting without it loses the entirety of progress made since opening the world.

I had no problem of this until today, when it stopped picking up saplings for a minute or so, and exiting took a full minute or so to reset.  But now it’s getting longer and exiting takes 10-20 minutes, and the glitch seems to be indefinite when it happens.  Does anyone know what is happening and how to fix it?

Changing the GB allotted, restarting Minecraft, restarting the computer, or playing online or offline so far have not worked.",0,3,2021-02-23 03:44:18,2021,2

DestinyTheGame,Alastor369,Can we remove “Challenge: The Shattered” from Petra’s bounty rotation until it’s fixed?,It’s really frustrating trying to grind out the reissued gear (not only because it’s yet again just reissued gear) when one of the sources is not working. I’m trying to get my hands on a Retold Tale with Quickdraw because I have a feeling it’s going to be the new meta shotgun. Grabbing a daily bounty that’ll give me three chances to nab one only to find out it’s broken and can’t be completed feels bad. Please remove it from the rotation until it’s fixed.

Minecraft,milesrhoden,Switch version remarkably unreliable,"I've been playing with friends in a bedrock realm trading between my xbox and switch. I love that the switch is portable - it's good for short sessions handling the farm or mining some ore - but WOW it is unreliable.

I constantly have to reboot the game and re-login to my microsoft account (which requires a nearby computer to enter the verification code) but the login often fails and I'm met with a new verification code to enter into my browser. At least I learned that clearing your login info from the in-game Settings menu can help.

These problems don't happen *every time* which is almost worse - it's just half the time your Minecraft session starts with ""Challenger Approaching! **Login again**!""

And when it's not that it's walking on invisible chunks or trying to open a chest or your inventory only to get a hanging load screen.

Seriously: The Switch is the ultimate pick-up-and-play system and this is the least reliable pick-up-and-play title on the Nintendo storefront. It feels like a real missed opportunity.

The xbox version isn't much better - my xbox one x (circa 2018) takes five whole minutes to boot up this game (5 times longer than any other game!) and despite its extra horsepower ""Realms"" are still bare minimum Minecraft.

You'd think ""Realms"" defaulting to potato settings would stabilize performance on systems like the Switch but nope!

I really want to get my nieces into Minecraft but their only option is the Switch version and for an adult (let alone a kid) this version plays more like an unpaid IT support job than a reliable game.

Am I missing something about Mojang's stance on their Switch port? Is there a reason it runs so poorly?

All the games that I have been playing have been with plats and golds, seen in this photo; (I know I didn't do well)

[I won 2 games and lost 3, with the games lost at 10-13, 10-13, and 9-13 \(this was my last game before being ranked\)](https://preview.redd.it/jh3hxfume5j61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e415766c906d72c61d1727e4ce7c469aa58348b)

&amp;#x200B;

So surely because I bottom fragged in a high gold/plat game doesn't mean i get placed silver 3. Did they change the ranking system?

Genshin_Impact,zdcoogle,My Idea for KFC colab,"TLDR; Instead of glider give us skin for diluc where it changes animations to match the theme of KFC and/or a skin for the wolf's gravestone or all greatswords where it looks like a chicken leg.

I am not a fan of the idea of getting a single glider as a reward for this colab like what's supposedly happening in China. It just doesn't seem grand enough for the first big colab(to my knowledge)

I think there should be either a diluc skin or new character that is a riff of diluc where his hair is changed to a silverish color and he gains a small gotee and his Q changes from a Phoenix sillouete into a more Chicken sillouete and his E be changed to leave ""bread crumbs"" instead of flames on the ground (would just be visual same effect) and if they wanted to really ball out change the voiceline for his Q to Finger Licken Good (with a better attempt at a southern/Kentucky accent) or give him a special weapon that literally a chicken leg. 

I understand that doing any of this would be an incredible amount of work and would probly slow stuff down a ton but itd also be super funny to walk around with a white haired diluc beating things to death with the power of chicken. sorry for the lack of visual aids I ain't that good of an artist.",6,0,2021-02-23 03:54:41,2021,2

I had about 50 fragile resin saved from the beginning, so I thought lets farm For TF set. I go to the domain and am horrified to find electro slimes. So, to farm for electro sets for your electro dps, you have to farm a domain in which enemies are immune to... Electro. Which degenerate motherfucker thought that this was a good idea?

Have to get carried in coop I guess, except its always other poor shmucks like me running keqing 50% of the time who dont have other effective characters.we make a team anyway and proceed to get wiped out. My other dps is Razor and triggering superconduct is suicide.

I go through this shit only to get slapped with a def% TS circlet.

Currently, Shadebinder has no way to shatter enemies outside of its super in terms of its abilities. The recent global nerfs have hit the warlock hard. So could the warlock get an aspect that lets them use the same ability as Elsie in that little cinematic that shows off stasis between the Drifter, Eris, and Elsie?

I know the ability is probably closer to a titans due to being a fist slam into the ground, and would be very similar to shatterdive. I just want a reliable way for my space wizard to kill enemies she freezes.",8,0,2021-02-23 04:03:19,2021,2

I'm sure you all heard them through your headphones. 

Well I use a 5.4.1 Dolby ATMOS system, and Bungie did an AMAZING job with those voices. ATMOS is all about ""3-D"" sound, and the way they did those voices literally was like they were surrounding me. They were all over the place coming from various speakers behind and above me, and they mixed it so the voices would flow from one speaker to another as they spoke. But the really cool thing was it was not just in a normal fashion, meaning the voice went from left to right and so on. No, they went the extra mile and the voice might be in the speaker that's beside me and flow to the front left one, and then go to the right rear and then go to the high-front right. It was so cool, and honestly a little bit intimidating.",14,85,2021-02-23 04:05:59,2021,2

DestinyTheGame,TheOreonator,Trials from a Incentive Rework Perspective,"I've seen quite a few discussion posts on Trials changes, but most suggestions I have seen push to change the game mode in a direction that reduces the difficulty or fundamentals.  Trials is endgame PvP content, and should remain challenging and difficult as such; however, I would argue that the reward structure needs to evolve for the health of the playlist.  The approach I would suggest is based around 3 types of incentives: incentives for flawless players, incentives for populating the playlist, and incentives for community ""inclusivity.""

**Incentive for flawless players**Currently, flawless cards are constantly farmed by the top echelon of PvP players in Trials.  Flawless is something desired by all, but only really pushed for by the top players since most of the lower skilled players don't see being able to achieve it as possible, and average players don't see it as a time investment worth pursuing, or they simply don't have the time needed to give a ""solid attempt.""  Once players have gone flawless on a card, the card should be marked as such, and they should be able to ""play out the card"" to compete with others who have gone flawless for HIGH (if it's low, the argument could be made that it would be easier to reset the card and farm more flawless cards) chances at additional adept rewards on wins.  Once the card hits the 3 allowed (4 on mercy) loses, the team would need to reset.  This would encourage players who have gone flawless to continue playing on their card for good rewards which would keep the top players at the end of the card and help to reduce the competitiveness at the lower end of the card.

**Incentive for populating the playlist**We need more loot.  No one wants to get stomped or sweat for hours only to get enough tokens for a few vendor drops and then have those drops be complete trash.  Tokens NEED to be granted on losses.  More tokens NEED to be granted on wins.  Encourage players to play more with guaranteed loot over time.  It says a lot that players are forming ""suicide squads"" just to get one reward and avoid the playlist as much as possible.  The system needs to move back towards the Destiny 1 system where pieces of Trials gear or weapons are granted on occasional game COMPLETIONS.  Note that does not say wins since this encourages early card farming similar to when Trials first returned in Season of the Worthy.  Wins should have a higher chance for a random drop, but should not be required.  This change should increase the overall population of trials and encourage the lower and average skilled players to remain in the playlist.

**Incentive for community ""inclusivity""**Right now, Trials feels very exclusive.  It is full of sweat and toxicity.  Encourage the playlist to be more inclusive.  The title requires carrying people to flawless who have never been to the lighthouse.  While this is a start, it is not incentive enough.  Once in a lifetime is too limited; open it up to once a week. ""After going to the lighthouse, help a player to the lighthouse while they have not gone to the lighthouse this week.""  Make it a bounty or challenge that grants an additional adept flawless reward.  If you really want to push for this kind of ""inclusivity,"" make it an adept weapon from a different week!  This would highly encourage players to assist others in getting to the lighthouse.  There is currently little incentive to help others.  This type of change would help push a cultural change in the playlist which is drastically needed.

**TL;DR:** More rewards/incentives are needed to increase and retain the population of Trials as well as encourage players to ""delve"" in the playlist more often.

**Edit 1:** After proof reading a few times, I completely missed the grammatical error in the title \*facepalm\*... ""Trials from an Incentive Rework Perspective.""",50,194,2021-02-23 04:16:49,2021,2

1. I wish that I'd used the Gift Pokémon that I'd gotten along the journey more. Especially in Johto where I didn't like my Pidgeot but used it anyways.
2. I wish that I hadn't turned the sound off when I played any of the games. I would often play at night when I was supposed to be asleep, but that led to me missing out on listening to the great OSTs the series had.
3. Evolving Murkrow and Pikachu so early was clearly a mistake. I wish I was more knowledgeable at the time about how evolution stones worked.
4. I never want to plan out my team ever again. It made my previous playthroughs pretty rigid in hindsight.",4,3,2021-02-23 04:21:44,2021,2

DestinyTheGame,Stryker1050,Guardian Ranks make sense to me now,"Since they got rid of some of the more ridiculous commemoration requirements, I think most of the objective make sense to me. I think people should have to run all the raids, dungeons, and GMs to climb to the top levels. Maybe the order of some requirements could still use some work though. 

I haven't looked at all the items for the top tiers, but I think since of the hardest normie achievements should be in the list. So going flawless in trials or solo flawlesing a dungeon would be fine, but 3 manning a raid would be too much. 

I also understand the reset. It might be nice to have 7 and 8 be a middle tier that didn't reset but isn't something a new light would compete super easily. Maybe it should be yearly instead of seasonally, but I think people should have to complete the most recent raid/dungeon to be top tier. It would also stop people from selling accounts of rank 11 guardians.

DestinyTheGame,Middle-Ear1666,Bungie’s disappointing treatment towards the Drifter and his gamemode,"There’s nothing absolutely more disappointing than Bungie’s overall treatment of our mysterious friend the Drifter. He’s a character full of lore, insight on the darkness and what lies beyond our solar system, and an incredible historian regarding the Dark Ages, and yet Bungie prefers to talk about the Bray sisters' daddy/grandpa issues or Crow’s ""overrated and over-extended"" storyline. 

Bungie treats him like Cayde-6 in the sense of ""He’s a gag character, but his lore is crazy good, but you gotta read all of the lore tabs in order to understand him."" I honestly want this to stop. I want Bungie to give Drifter a bigger role like in Joker’s Wild, a role that makes him THE guide regarding the darkness.

I just hope the Season of the Deep is related to him and Eris since they seem to be the only ones that actually give a damn regarding understanding the darkness, but that’ll remain to be seen. I just hope they don’t spend too much time on their ""relationship"" since I know Bungie is going to psyche us out by doing something super stupid, like Crow and Amanda’s pointless ""love"" or friendship story.

pokemongo,skizz0phrenia,"Dearest Niantic, hear me out...","I have 136 friends on your 2016 smash success mobile ARG game, Pokémon GO. Of this number, I have personally ever met four of them. To be completely honest, the rest are just there for me to mindlessly sling all my gifts at for a little xp as I pin their postcards I'm just going to delete later for a little more candy and tear open my allotted ration of gifts in order to stuff my bag with all the items the powers that be have decreed I am allowed to have without spending my allowance of 50 coins on a total steal of a deal box from your very competetively priced shop.

I don't know these alleged ""friends"" of mine, and I likely never will. Most sit in a sort of limbo, not really existing to me in the void between extremes. We are 'friends' only so that we can grossly take from each other with no actual regard for the other's well-being. I feel this abuse of the Friend system has come to dominate the experience of playing Pokémon GO in a way which Niantic never intended. I believe changes are necessary for the long-term longevity of the game, and should not be taken lightly. This is what I propose - No limit to how many gifts can be opened during a day, but each gift costs 5 coins to send and 5 coins to open. I believe this would improve the unique experience of building kinship with our fellow humans and place more value on each of us as individuals. Thank you for doing the work of Arceus.

PS - I think PokeCoin gain from gyms should be capped at 25 per week. This would help rebalance the game and ensure it is enjoyed by trainers for years to come.",5,0,2023-03-31 03:39:59,2023,3

- They say ""We hear you, so we made the update less bad"".

pokemon,ToadBrigade5,"Teddiursa &amp; Ursaring - Toad's Daily Pokémon Ranking, 216 &amp; 217","[Introducing the first Normal type line to gain an evolution with a new typing in a later generation!](https://preview.redd.it/e8x09g7jvzqa1.png?width=1437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6a06968e95009f80b763b1591d1a9cc6f7ae8378)

**216: Teddiursa**

Teddiursa is an absolutely adorable teddy bear Pokémon and I like it a lot! I think in the whacky over the top Pokedex we've covered in Johto, Teddiursa stands out for striking a very unique balance. It's both a cute, simple design but it has it's own vibes and identity going for it beyond that - with it's connection both to bear cubs and the moon, presented on it's forehead. 

Teddiursa surprisingly got a lot of focus in recent generations that elevated it's presence to me - it's line was featured as one of the 10 core Pokémon in Legends Arceus, and then it got to be the ace Pokemon of Gym Leader Katy in Paldea, using a Bug Type Tera Form representing it's honey in her baking. I think the biggest thing that made me realize how pleasant Teddiursa's vibes were that the as the Pokémon showed up more, I didn't mind it at all and smiled as though it was a core regular in the franchise.

I think at the end of the day, Teddiursa is simple but it starts off a good line in a strong way, and I like it. I'm a sucker for stuffed animals in real life and it's just a cute Pokémon with some neat behaviors. It's too simple to be one of my favorites, but I think a low **B Tier** score is quite fitting.

[Fanart found on Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/qr9xxfddwzqa1.jpg?width=256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6481974100415ae3004db2e6fda0990f511529bd)

&amp;#x200B;

**217: Ursaring**

This one is kind of disappointing though. Despite being the final stage for Teddiursa for a very long time, Ursaring really felt way too boring and simple by comparison. Like Noctowl, it seems to abandon most of Teddiursa's motifs like honey, stuffed animals, and night time, but unlike Noctowl, it isn't charismatic enough of a design to pick up the slack. 

Ursaring is just... a bear. A bear with a yellow circle on it's belly which took me way too long was still supposed to be a full moon. But it still feels like a last ditch attempt, like Teddiursa was just another Johtonian one-stage line that they realize could not stand alone, and came running in with a random bear and painted a yellow circle on it's belly to claim it still preserved the motif.

I don't hate it, it's cool enough, they do some cool things with it. I like how it looks in the modern games, and watching Teddiursas gather around an Alpha Ursaring was really really neat. But it still is... disappointing, and feels incredibly average for a promising line. **C Tier.**

But man. Man oh man do I LOVE it's evolution. Ursaluna for the absolute win! We'll get to that in a few years.

I've always felt like there were far too little ways to build into AE if you really wanted to go that route (To be fair, it's been getting better, but my point still stands). Honestly, I think something like this is just a minor oversight. Who knows, maybe they actually planned to do this already, at a later time. But they should also consider allowing weapon barrels and weapon sights (for those few that actually have them) to also influence things like AE (if they haven't already).

I have no idea why this happened. I was just testing enchant levels in a single player world, then this happened. I had the vanilla tweaks texture pack on, so I assumed it was that, well turned it off and what do you know, it is still being happening, I also moved around and turn the weather on and off, but still the same issue. I then removed all texture packs from the texture pack folder, and still had the same issue. I even left the world and rejoined, and yet; same issue.

pokemon,OlimarsSneakyDealing,One thing that I’m glad Scarlet and Violet brought back to the franchise,"For Gens 1-5, Pokémon games were constantly building off of each other. You can tell with every entry that they wanted to out-do themselves and make each game bigger and better than the last. Gen 5 felt like they really put their all into the game. 

But once Gen 6 came around, it seemed like the games kind of stayed stagnant. They didn’t really care about making a better game than the older ones, just making a game that reminds you of the older ones. All the focus that used to be on improving the series went towards marketing gimmicks instead of improvement. 

It worked, Pokemon became more successful than ever during the Gen 6-8 era. So I can’t say they made the wrong choice. 

But Gen 9 finally feels like Gamefreak wants to make something special again. They fell short in many aspects, but I can see the soul in the series again. It feels like they actually want to improve the series instead of just keeping everything the same and changing one or two things. 

I’m excited for the future. I hope the next game can be the one where it all comes together perfectly.",24,19,2022-11-28 08:15:09,2022,11

Genshin_Impact,NokMok,Surface Book 3 detaches when starting Genshin.,"I play Genshin on the MS Surface Book 3 since day one. This PC has two graphic cards, an Intel in the screen and an NVidia in the keyboard. The screen is detachable and works solo as a tablet.

Since 3.0, when I start the game from its launcher, there is a very high chance that the screen will detach during the warning / before the title screen. This crashes the game and removes the NVidia graphic card from the system.

In order to play the game, I need to manually separate and reattach the screen This takes 4 tries on average (± 4 tries).

Since 3.0 I have been through multiple Windows, drivers and Surface updates, but the issue persists.

pokemon,purple-tears,why are the other Paradox's not Legendaries and Koraidon and Miraidon are?,"
Spoilers ahead for end-game, so if you haven't completed The Way Home (4th storyline after completing Victory Road, Path of Legends, and Operation Starfall), leave now.

If Koraidon and Miraidon are just Past and Future Paradox forms of Cyclizar, then what makes them so special compared to the Paradox forms, like Past Salamence or Future Tyranitar? If anything, they should be weaker, Cyclizar is a 1 stage evo pokemon with mediocre stats and isn't very viable in a playthrough. Salamence, Tyranitar, Gardevoir/Gallade, all are beasts in their own right, and are just as much in their Paradox forms. But for some reason, gamefreak appears to have just made Paradox Cyclizar a Gary/Mary Sue for some reason?

I just think the roles of and choice for the legendary pokemon in these games are just poor and lazy and don't make sense when faced with the reasoning and logic behind their legendary titles, when there are other paradoxes of stronger pokemon that pale in comparison (stats-wise and title-wise) for some reason.
This is not a diss on Koraidon and Miraidon, I love them both in design, but the reasoning for them being legendaries but not the other Paradox's makes no sense to me. Obviously, if they were all legendaries, that'd just be too many, so I don't think they should've made Koraidon and Miraidon legendaries.

I'm definitely thinking too much on this, but honestly, I don't think the people who made them thought enough.",19,0,2022-11-28 08:23:27,2022,11

Why is that exactly? I look at the wiki and you can increase the hemorrhage buildup on weapons already causing bleed even further putting blood affinity on them.

I think I read somewhere that even though you increase the bleed buildup the bleed proc damage gets lower or something on weapons that already have a hemorrhage passive.

I tried a bunch of different programs and spent hours trying to prefect it and would like to share the macro file for other users so they can save some time and some runes. I had a lot of issues stemming from the fact that you don't spawn exactly in the same spot upon fast travelling, so I had to devise a way that even if the script fails and you don't hit him, or if you aggro him without him falling off, you don't continue moving and fall off thus loosing your runes, you'll see what I mean if you have a look. I've managed to get it to about 80% success, so you're easily looking at 1 million + runes an hour without having to do anything. My controls are standard wasd for movement, ijkl for camera movement, right click for staff attack,  q = target, g = map, f = grace list when map is open and e = select grace teleport.

As for the gear I'm using the meteorite staff and rock sling, so no need to buy arrows.

All you'll have to do is download macrogamer, load this profile and select run, then navigate to the game and make sure you fast travel to ""palace approach ledge-road"" and don't move, then press enter on the numpad to run the macro.

I bet a ton of people can’t even spot it out by the mountains anymore and most people aren’t even aware it’s there. Was there any mention of it at all after the season it was shot down in concluded? (I need an answer to this the most)

Why does it bug me so much? Why did it not have a bigger role in season of the splicer’s whole Vex Incursion theme? like a gate they linked to on the ship would’ve made a lot on sense especially because it was using Mercury as gunpowder! Idk why but the Almighty weighs so heavily on my mind maybe just because it was such a big deal throughout Red War and Season of the Worthy and then nothing after it was shot down, nothing! Like what happened to the Guardian trapped in a time freeze on the ship?? The Almighty upsets me greatly.",5,0,2023-03-29 10:33:45,2023,3

I'm on my second playthrough and decide to go  faith/arcane for the dragon communion spells and I've been having a blast. The thing is I'm doing so much damage with the spells that the fight is too short to have fun. In addition, going melee is also part of the fun so most of the time I'm just going full melee for the whole fight. At first, leveling was reduvia and Eleonora poleblade and afterward I was powerstancing River of blood +8 and a sepukku occult uchigatana +21. The damage were quite good (28 faith/45 arcane) and was hitting on average 1200damage with powerstanced jumping attack but I got tired of that and wanted to Switch to another weapon.

I've tried marais greatsword+8 (around 800 dmg on strong jumping attack), occult flamberge +17 (around 700 dmg) and the damage is abysmal for the area (moutaintops of the giant). 

Am I doing something wrong? Do you have any other suggestions for weapon/duawielding options?",12,0,2023-03-29 10:49:22,2023,3

pokemongo,Resident-Scallion949,Just Back from Hoenn Go Tour Vegas--My Observations,"Just got back home last night, spending both Saturday and Sunday at the event with my wife and mother.  As a background, I'm a middle-aged man (if 102 is full aged), and originally started playing POGO in 2016.  Took a break for a while, but picked it up again a few years ago to have a shared activity with my wife after her disability.  Mom, who is in her 70s, picked up the game in October, since she saw how much fun we had.

Here are our observations:

1. Aside from the system being overwhelmed on Saturday morning, game play went somewhat smoothly for us.  We did sometimes need to turn the wi-fi off and reconnect or use phone data. Not sure what Niantic did to improve connectivity after the first rush, but if it was to boost their resources, why weren't they maxed at the beginning?
2. The temps were cool, but the shade was sparse.  Eerie Mists and Verdant Earth had plenty of natural shade, with trees and structures, but Ancient Shores and Blistering Sands (lived up to its name).  Some additional man made structures (pop-ups, etc) would have been nice.
3. We were instructed to limit the amount of water to bring in (plus, how much water can a trainer carry while playing?), and use the ""hydration stations.""  Unfortunately, there were only two in the entire park, and they were placed in inconvenient areas.  
4. On the subject of water, we felt that Niantic missed a revenue generator (which is rare for them) by not offering water for sale.  They could have easily set up several stations throughout the park selling cold bottled water.
5. On the topic of missed revenue streams, why is the only merchandise available at the event the official event T-Shirt?  And why only have two tables with mile long lines?  For very little effort, a small section could have easily been created to rent space to vendors selling other Pokemon-related merch.  Personally, I had money set aside to buy souvenirs, but couldn't spend it.  
6. More food options would have been nice.  As it was, there were only about 10 trucks, but they were arranged in a horseshoe, leading to a mass of humanity in the middle.  The idea of joining that mass was daunting.  
7. And don't think we could go to the local restaurants very easily.  I wonder if they were given a heads-up about the event, because from my perspective, the restaurants I saw were understaffed and under-supplied for the number of potential customers they had.
8. Speaking of long lines, the Meet and Greets alternated between two characters.  So if one wanted to have a pic with both Eevee and Pikachu, they would need to wait in line twice.  This issue could have easily been remedied by having two costumes for each character.
9. Spinda Stops were great.  They ensured we saw all parts of the park.  I certainly wouldn't have put in 25KM during the two days without having to search for those stops.
10. Niantic missed the boat on another potential revenue channel:  Special Trades.  It was great getting six Special Trades while in the park, but even that many caused extreme planning, and inability to have spontaneous trades.  For $15, I would have been happy to pay for unlimited (or at least additional) Special Trades.
11. Wife and I BOTH got Shiny Relicanths, which completed our Hoenn Pokedex!

Again, we all had a great time with the event, but feel it could have been even better with a few other features.",2,8,2023-02-21 18:34:27,2023,2

Even in the GAA event, Mona states that “Fischl is now an adult” which would make her at least 18, no?

By “before the 2 year mark” I mean Fischl could have turned 14 long before electro visions stopped being recieved

No other expansions &amp; I do not have any seasons.


I know that Lightfall drops in about a week from now, but I'm not terribly sure what to do before then. I'm aware of the fact I should get all the artifacts for my 3 basic subclasses (no darkness since no beyond light atm) but other than that, I'm lost.

 
I don't have the season pass since its gonna end in a week &amp; I haven't bought Lightfall yet because it isn't even out yet, and I want to make sure I get back into the game before buying it. 


If anyone has suggestions on what to go after, exotic quests to complete, ""meta"" guns to chase after, really just stuff I'm able to do to prep for Lightfall, that would be so swell. I can provide more info on what I've got if anyone would like it, idk if knowing what exotics I already have or whatever would be useful.

So on the one hand, the Golden Order excluded death from the Elden Ring so that nobody could die without the Rune of Death's power (but those who still somehow die are fed to the erdtree?). On the other hand, everyone we come across dies and disappears. People get killed and cursed by the Dung Eater, NPCs we kill disappear or die on us during their quests like with Yura or Milicent, and every boss dies after we go through them. With the exception of Morgott, who lives even when he dies and later for some reason gets given grace in his last moments of life, but he still dies afterwards so it's not grace which allows people to keep coming back to life?

And it can be assumed death doesn't return to the world unless you pick the Rune of Death ending and allow the dried husks that roam the land to die. So why are people allowed to die in the Lands Between, even though it's been specifically stated that nobody may die? Unless the game assumes we use the Godslayer Greatsword or the Black Knife from the moment our tarnished awakens to deliver destined death to everything in its path?",6,5,2023-02-21 19:31:00,2023,2

Eldenring,xiyu96,I asked ChatGPT to write a script for a demigod family reunion.,"It doesn't know much about Elden Ring as it came out after 2021, but we had a chat about the characters and I gave it as much detail as I could. Here's what it came up with.

FADE IN:

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The restaurant is decorated with elegant chandeliers, exquisite paintings, and gold-plated cutlery. The table is set with an array of delicious dishes and glasses of wine. The family members sit around the table, looking uncomfortable and tense.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA 

(to the waiter) 

Can we get some more wine over here?

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(to Radagon)

So, I heard you're married to Marika now.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAGON

(smiling awkwardly)

Uh, yes. That's correct.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(to Mohg)

And you're following a blood goddess now? That's interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(defensive)

Hey, don't judge me. I'm just exploring my options.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(to Malenia)

And you're still cursed with the Scarlet Rot? That's rough.

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

(smiling wryly)

You could say that. But at least I still have my sense of humor.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(to Ranni)

So, how's life as a doll treating you?

&amp;#x200B;

RANNI

(irritated)

Oh, it's just great. I love being trapped in this plastic body for eternity.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAHN

(to Miquella)

I heard you created a divine tree. That's impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

MIQUELLA

(proudly)

Thank you. I try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

MELINA

(to Marika)

So, when are you going to let me out of this shade form?

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(coldly)

Never. You tried to overthrow me. That's not something I can just forgive and forget.

&amp;#x200B;

The waiter returns with a bottle of wine and pours it into Marika's glass.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIA

(to the waiter)

Make sure it's the good stuff. We're demigods, after all.

&amp;#x200B;

The waiter nods nervously and hurries away.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(raising his glass)

To family reunions. They're always awkward, but at least we're not mortal.

&amp;#x200B;

The family members reluctantly raise their glasses in a toast.

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

(muttering to himself)

If only they knew the curse I'm planning to unleash on them.

&amp;#x200B;

The camera zooms out as the family members continue their dinner, the tension palpable in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

VOICE

(off-screen)

Sorry, sorry, I'm late!

&amp;#x200B;

The demigods turn to see Miquella, dressed in a child-sized tuxedo and carrying a briefcase, rushing towards the table.

&amp;#x200B;

MIQUELLA

(panting)

I had to attend to some business. Did I miss anything?

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

Just the usual, brother. I saved you a seat.

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(To Radahn)

Radahn dearest, why do you insist on bringing that horse everywhere with you? You've surely outgrown it by now.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAHN

(nervously)

Leonard is not just a horse, mother. He's my faithful companion and my trusted mount. And besides, he's much better behaved than some of my fellow guests here tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(rolling his eyes)

Oh please, Radahn. Leonard is just a horse. And you're not fooling anyone with your little gravity tricks. I could do that too, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

(calmly)

Please, let's not start arguing again. Can we all just enjoy this evening together?

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(agitated)

Where's that darn lion of mine? Serosh! Serosh, where are you boy?

&amp;#x200B;

RANNI

(giggling)

You really need to keep that lion under control. Last time we had a family dinner, he nearly ate the waiter. Speaking of being eaten, how's life inside the God-Devouring Serpent, Rykard?

&amp;#x200B;

RADAGON

(smirking)

Oh come on now, let's not be rude. We're here to enjoy each other's company and celebrate our family bond.

&amp;#x200B;

MELINA

(whispering from the shadows)

And plan my revenge, but sure, let's pretend to have a good time.

&amp;#x200B;

MIQUELLA

(whispering back)

Melina, please. You know mother can hear you.

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(sighing)

Oh Melina, dear, do come join us at the table. You're still a part of this family, even if you are just a shade.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(grinning)

Hey, Melina, I hear you tried to take down Marika. That's hilarious.

&amp;#x200B;

MELINA

(glaring)

Shut up, Mohg. You're just jealous you didn't think of it first.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(interrupting)

Can we please just order some food? I'm starving over here.

&amp;#x200B;

WAITER

(approaching the table)

Good evening, demigods. Welcome to the Golden Table. What can I get for you tonight?

&amp;#x200B;

RANNI

(smiling)

I'll have the moonfish, please. Extra moon sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(chuckling)

And I'll have the serpent steak, well-done. Hold the venom.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(impatiently)

I'll take whatever's the quickest to make. I have a kingdom to run, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN is fumbling with something under the table. The camera zooms in to show a sprig of deathroot.

&amp;#x200B;

MORGOTT

(noticing Godwyn's fumbling)

What are you doing there, brother?

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

(startled)

Nothing! Just adjusting my... shoe!

&amp;#x200B;

MIQUELLA

(smiling suspiciously)

You don't wear shoes, brother.

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

(nervously)

Oh... right. Well, I'm just... playing footsie with... myself!

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(rolls her eyes)

Honestly, Godwyn, could you be any more obvious?

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

(smiling wickedly)

I think I know what he's up to. Deathroot, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

(defensively)

What? No! I don't know what you're talking about!

&amp;#x200B;

RADAGON

(interrupting)

Let's not get into another family squabble, shall we? It's supposed to be a nice dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(sarcastically) 

Oh, yes. Nothing says ""nice dinner"" like a bunch of demigods with cursed limbs and blood magic!

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone looks at Rykard disapprovingly.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(realizing his mistake)

Sorry. Bad joke.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(clearing her throat)

Let's try to keep things civil, shall we? We are family, after all.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(chuckling)

Family? Please. We're all just pawns in our mother's game of thrones.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone glares at Mohg.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(shrugging)

What? It's true.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAGON

(looking at the menu)

I'll have the roasted quail.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(nodding)

Same here.

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(looking at the menu)

I'll have the salmon.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(sarcastically)

Salmon? I thought you were a sorceress, not a fisherman.

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(irritated)

I happen to like salmon.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(smiling)

Just teasing, mother.

&amp;#x200B;

MELINA

(whispering from the corner)

Can I have the... wait, I don't need to order anything. I'm already dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone looks at Melina uncomfortably.

&amp;#x200B;

MIQUELLA

(trying to break the tension)

I'll have the steak, medium-rare.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(looking at the menu)

I'll have the... (pauses) Actually, can I just have a bowl of blood?

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone stares at Mohg in disbelief.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(defensively)

What? It's a delicacy in some cultures.

&amp;#x200B;

MORGOTT

(whispering to Mohg)

Brother, we talked about this. No blood magic at the table.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(whispering back)

But it's just a little...

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

(interrupting)

I'll have the lamb. And a side of deathroot, please.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone groans in unison.

&amp;#x200B;

WAITER

(writing down the orders)

Very good. And for the children?

&amp;#x200B;

The camera pans to show Miquella and the doll that Ranni now inhabits.

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

(smiling)

He'll have the chicken fingers.

&amp;#x200B;

RANNI

(in a high-pitched voice)

And I'll have the... (pauses) Well, I don't really eat anymore, but thanks for asking!

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone looks at Ranni's doll body with a mixture of sadness and discomfort.

&amp;#x200B;

WAITER

(nodding)

Of course. And for you, sir? (gestures to Leonard)

&amp;#x200B;

RADAHN: He'll have a bucket of your most expensive hay.

&amp;#x200B;

The WAITER looks confused, but tries to hide it.

&amp;#x200B;

WAITER

I'm sorry, sir. We don't serve hay here.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAHN

What do you mean you don't serve hay? It's a fancy restaurant, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

Radahn, let's not cause a scene.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAHN

Fine, fine. Just bring him some water then.

&amp;#x200B;

The WAITER nods and walks away, still looking perplexed.

&amp;#x200B;

MIQUELLA

Have you heard about Mohg's new dynasty?

&amp;#x200B;

MORGOTT

Don't even get me started on that. Mohg has always been trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

Hey! What's that supposed to mean?

&amp;#x200B;

MORGOTT

(sighing)

You know what it means, Mohg. You're always trying to start something.

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

Speaking of trouble, did anyone notice Godwyn playing with deathroot again?

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN tries to hide the deathroot under the table, but it's too late.

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

(sighing)

I'm sorry, I just can't help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

RYKARD

(chuckling)

You know, they say laughter is the best medicine. Maybe you should try that instead.

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(suddenly getting emotional)

Oh, Radagon. I just miss our old life together. Before everything fell apart.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAGON

Rennala, we were never meant to be together.

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(sobbing)

I know, but I just can't help feeling this way.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the family looks uncomfortable as Rennala continues to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(trying to change the subject)

So, who's excited for dessert?

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

I'd be more excited to eat if I wasn't dead! After Ranni murdered me! Has everyone forgotten about that?

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone looks uncomfortable and shifts in their seats.

&amp;#x200B;

MALENIA

(awkwardly)

Well, at least you're not alone in your curse. I too am afflicted by the Scarlet Rot.

&amp;#x200B;

GODWYN

(sarcastically)

Oh, great. So we can be a duo of cursed siblings. Maybe we can form a band.

&amp;#x200B;

MOHG

(smiling slyly)

And I'll be your manager. The Mohgwyn dynasty has to expand its portfolio, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

MELINA

(creepily)

I can be your ghostly backup singer.

&amp;#x200B;

The table falls silent for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(attempting to lighten the mood)

So, Rennala, how's life as a single mother of three?

&amp;#x200B;

RENNALA

(smiling)

It has its challenges, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Ranni is excelling in her magical studies, Rykard has found a new home in the God-Devouring Serpent, and Radahn is still...well, Radahn.

&amp;#x200B;

RADAHN

(defensively)

Hey, I heard that!

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(clearing her throat)

Now, now, let's not fight. We're here to celebrate our family and our continued existence as demigods.

&amp;#x200B;

GODFREY

(gruffly)

And to eat some damn good food, I hope.

&amp;#x200B;

The waiter approaches the table.

&amp;#x200B;

WAITER

Good evening, demigods. May I recommend our specialty entree, the Erdtree steak?

&amp;#x200B;

The camera pans to show the horrified expressions on everyone's faces, especially Marika's.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(growing angry)

How dare you suggest such a thing! The Erdtree is sacred and should never be consumed.

&amp;#x200B;

WAITER

My apologies, ma'am. I didn't realize.

&amp;#x200B;

MARIKA

(to the group)

This is exactly why we can't have nice things. We can't even have a peaceful family dinner without someone disrespecting our beliefs.

&amp;#x200B;

The tension at the table continues to rise. Suddenly the camera zooms in on Godwyn, who's still holding the sprig of deathroot and looking mischievous.

VALORANT,Not_Bre4d,How do I not become demotivated with playing?,"Probably a skill issue on my part because I barely have any hours on the game, but I'm trying to get into Valorant and its very demotivating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm coming over from a Splatoon competitive team (its kids game I know laugh all you want)  and I'm reasonably good at the game competitive-wise. Coming into Valorant is very demotivating, I either bottom-frag and get 3 kills max or do reasonably well. Normally with Splatoon matches are 5 minutes, so if I have a bad game I know its over reasonably quick, but with Valorant I'm stuck getting picked off first.

&amp;#x200B;

Again most likely a skill issue and I shouldn't be complaining and trying to fix it, but trying to stick to playing more than 1 match is very draining.",99,261,2023-03-30 09:10:45,2023,3
pokemongo,InferiorVenom,Is pvp supposed to be this shit?,"So I've decided to pick pokemon go up again after many years away. I see there's now a pvp battle league style system and all I can say is: 'wow, is it meant to be this bad?' First of all its just a button mash. I know gyms were like that but i figured that was just how you played against a computer. Is pvp really just a contest of who can tap their screen faster? Well no, it's also a question of who's luckier. There's no team preview so you better hope your team matches up well from the start or you're fucked, you only get 1 switch after all. And the coup de grace; the charge attack button which actually seems to be a ""give your opponent a charge attack"" button. Seriously; every game that I hit that fucking button both pokemon stop for a second then my opponent gets an attack. Every. Fucking. Time. Yes I'm quite pissed off about it. How could a spin off of a franchise literally defined by its battle system be so shit? Does anyone actually enjoy this, or are we meant to just put up with it because it's not like they'll ever fix it.",0,2,2023-03-30 09:11:30,2023,3

Eldenring,Destructive_Forces,Tinfoil Hat Theory regarding the Shadow of the Erdtree Image,"That's not the Haligtree or the Erdtree. It's Godwin's Deathroot tree, growing beneath the Erdtree. That's not a sky, it's deeper into the earth. Those aren't clouds, it's Death ash. That's not rotting tree debris surrounding the tree, it's the swarms of insects associated with Godwin's ""trees"". **This is Godwin's dream**, and this is specifically *St. Trina* and **not** Miquella. 

We've already seen underground areas in the game that would look entirely like the surface if the ""ceiling"" wasn't visible. The absurd number of gravestones you can see, as well as the larger stone coffins that are actually tangible, makes me associate this with any of the areas in the game that the undead spawn in, i.e. the huge gravesite atop the Mountain of the Giants. 

The presence of Miquella would mean this has to be in the past or in a dream, and this appearing to be them in the form of St. Trina reinforces the latter. I definitely don't perceive this figure on the spectral steed as being childlike in stature. We also don't actually know if that's Torrent, as there almost certainly are/have been more than one Spectral Steed in existence. It's entirely possible it's an as-yet-unknown Steed.

My guess is you will have to beat either Mohg or Fortissax to enter the DLC area, which makes sense because I'm sure this area will be balanced for a character who already beat the main game. Those two areas are some of the few ""dead ends"" in the game past big, optional bosses, and each is associated with the respective characters still there, dreaming.",8,3,2023-02-28 09:58:48,2023,2

Past future or just to a different place  would thst not be sick?

pokemon,CommonD,I am pretty sure Walking Wake is a convergent species rather than a direct ancestor or relative of Suicune,"The reasoning behind this statement:
- Suicune is a kitten, not a birdo
- Unlike all paradox forms, regional forms, and even the other convergent mons, there isn't any proportionality or direct retention of stats
- Same for the movepool, other than the commonly learnt water type moves, Walking Wake does not learn any of the Flying, Psychic, and Ice type moves that are commonly associated with Suicune.
- The burnt tower fiasco, even though it may be just a legend to mourn a once beloved monument, so this last one is a weak one

What I think is that Walking Wake has developed similar attributes to those of Suicune because those attributes help it to fill a similar ecological niche in a Suicune-less ancient Pokémon world.",14,0,2023-02-28 10:05:22,2023,2

Genshin_Impact,feicash,Everything counts,"It's something that 80% of the playerbase won't ever understand

Everything counts

Every single shit you get in/out the game is important

For example, the daily login:

""It's just 60 primogems""

It's not only ""just 60"" it's 60 (and literally 0 effort to get it)

A legendary quest it's not ""just 60 primogems""

- It's mora

- It's books

- It's weapon crystals

- It's AR XP

- And also it's primogems

""""B-but it's shitty amounts!""

That's probably the answer given by anyone who can't understand that EVERYTHING COUNTS

Genshin requires grinding, after grinding you get your reward

No grinding=0 resources

You ""don't"" farm one thing when you need it

You farm everything at the same time but in a smaller scale

That's the reason why you wonder your friend is rich in terms of crystals, books, primogems or mora

Because he/she knows that everything counts

Edit: some people getting the ""grinding part"" too literal

Like, you don't need to idk kill every monster in your world everyday

It's more like ""you need this flower but don't have time? 
Ok, go buy it in shops and plant seeds on your teapot. It's slow but you'll get what you need""",11,0,2023-02-28 10:06:25,2023,2

I like making the character in the creator but as soon as I hit the open world I suddenly lose all motivation to progress the character because I remember how long it takes to level up and find upgrade materials. In Bloodborne and DS3 I didn't have much of a problem because it was more linear and contained. Thinking about all the scattered items is overwhelming. I know bell bearings make things easier but those are even more progression gated.

The burnout really sucks because there are so many possibilities....Mind you, this is after making 5 characters and grinding them out. I have a friend who helps me dupe things, and that helps, but then I still need to hunt for upgrade materials if I want to do pvp after leveling with dropped runes. I want to get to the meat of my build and just play it.

The DLC was just announced. I think it was called Shadow of the Erdtee?

If the Erdtree isn't burned and Miquella is out in the world, this suggests that it is pre-Shattering.

I think it's the immediate aftermath of Godwyn's death. The parasite strangling the Erdtree has a cloud like Deathblight coming off it, and we know that it left Deathroot all over the Lands Between.

Godwyn was buried beneath its roots as well, so it makes sense that his initial eruption would happen here. I just don't think anyone had considered that it would be THIS dramatic.

As we all hoped the newly announced Elden Ring DLC ""shadow of the erdtree"" will tackle Miquella and the unalloyed gold. He's riding a spectral steed, although I wouldn't say it's Torrent (our own steed) until further confirmation, although it may have sense as we've never know who his former master was. If it's really Miquella, I'm curious to see what ties he's with Ranni (she uses something very close to what we'd call sleep magic when we first encounter her, it's plausible she learned it from her half-brother himself), and why he gave her the spirit-calling bell, or with Melina (I won't include any speculation about her being the Gloam-eyed Queen, this post will already be long enough, although I support that theory), as she's the one who gifts us the ring to summon Torrent. 
-
The ""young"" Empirean riding a land covered in ghostly graves has me thinking. For once, this may be a sort of lore explanation of the various spirit NPCs we see around the world, (like the one at the beginning of the game, pointing at the Cave of Knowledge), especially when considering how there're multiple spectres visible in the distance. My first thought about the sword/effigy-like shape goes to a great rune (like the one Queen Marika's always represented being crucified onto).
-
Talking about the landscape, the buildings remind me of the structures found at the Lake of Liurnia. The mist is an interesting and recurrent theme, and i wouldn't exclude at all the idea of this setting being a sort of dreamscape. After all, we're still talking about St.Trina, therefore it'd be quite plausible this being a dream-ish version of the Lands Between. 
-
Last but not least, the Erdtree (or maybe what the Haligtree should've been?) is shaped similarly to a Miquella's lily,  and is dripping golden amber. This may be a hint about a plausible new ending unlockable if the Empirean will ever wake up from his slumber. The newly obtained unalloyed gold would seal off the Outer Gods and would bring the Golden Order principles to an end, granting equality to all living being (alive or not). Substantially, it'd be the best ending obtainable, along with Ranni's (imo; you're free to disagree with all I'm saying), when considering a moral compass pointing at the most well-being of all the Lands Between. 
-
Sorry for the long analysis, I've not gone much in depth as it'd have required a lore dissection about characters, and there're already long essays about that, made by much more competent people than me. Also, pardon me for my possible typos, English isn't my first language. Thanks to all who have come this far into reading, it means a lot, truly~ ✨",7,5,2023-02-28 10:32:36,2023,2

Eldenring,maskuraid,Discussing the Significance of the Double Helix and its Links to Divine Beings in Elden Ring,"  

Firstly, if you’re reading this post thinking “I don’t mind a small spoiler” this isn’t for you. While I’m not delving into massive detail (I want to evoke discussion moreso than stating fact), the topics I want to discuss spoil Lore, Story, and key moments in the plot of Elden Ring. You have been warned.

Anyway…

Recently, I've been looking into the significance of the double helix in Elden Ring. We see this symbol peppered throughout the game in a few different contexts. One obvious example is the Sacred Relic Sword, but also various other weapons such as the Godslayer and Giant’s seal, and the Godslayer’s Great Sword. It also appears in the petals that for Scarlet Aoenia, and a couple of other incantations. It seems to me to be a symbol of godhood, or divinity in general. The Helix wraps two objects together into one. This seems to me to reference the duality of Marika and Radagon, and I would consider this bond to be between the mortal Marika, and the Outer God of Order, Radagon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Various weapons depicting the pattern](https://preview.redd.it/59s4llg30pqa1.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60e04b51bfc6b2b4f5cdd191c9fadd92169c09d7)

This concept of Duality in Gods isn’t unique to Marika. Her children share a similar state of being. While there is this Outer God of Rot (God being used in its Male context), and Malenia, Goddess of Rot. Perhaps the 3rd Bloom is a part of a binding ritual that makes the lines between Malenia and the God of Rot blur out of existence, explaining why we see the Petals of the Scarlet Aeonia form this double helix. Furthering this, (and I’m about to talk about some speculation based on cut content) we have Miquella and St. Trina, who also have this duality to them. The Man, Miquella, fuses with the Woman, St. Trina to become one entity. perhaps communion with some outer god is required for a mortal to become a god. Radagon, a God of Order, The God of Rot, and Quella, the God of Sleep mentioned in Dark Souls 2 ((Mi)Quella as pointed out by Vaati Vidya).

&amp;#x200B;

[Scarlet Aeonia forming a helix](https://preview.redd.it/vjzwy62d0pqa1.png?width=337&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35fa0376f3ced2f003691c557d45110c9e2d898a)

The double Helix may be meant to represent this fusion into one divine being. The unravelling helix may support this further. The Unravelling Helix of the Godslayer Greatsword representing the forceful removal of the God's mortal half in an effort to kill both. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Godslayer Greatsword](https://preview.redd.it/97736pc7zoqa1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=72d670f7b7a9af6fde9b0558985426259aa4ddf7)

&amp;#x200B;

We even participate in this ritual ourselves. With the help of Melina (Who is widely considered to be the Gloam Eyed Queen and former master of the Godslayers/Godskins as seen in the Frenzied Flame Ending), leads us to the Erdtree, where Marika's Mortal form hangs crucified above the battlefield, allowing us the ability to slay her otherwise immortal form Radagon. We tear the helix partitions apart and put marika to rest. However, the Elden Beast emerges to form a sword from Radagon’s torn human form, the sword crafting its blade from Radagon’s flesh made Corpse Wax, the bind the helix together. Killing the Elden Beast, we can Slay the God Marika and create our order. Perhaps the Mending Runes we use is how we begin our own communion with the Outer God of our choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

DestinyTheGame,rediscov409,Bungie is taking Destiny in the direction they feel is best for the game. It is ok if you don't like it.,"It is also ok if you stop playing because of it. Bungie has a vision for what Destiny should be, they are the creators after all. It is OK if you don't like this vision and it is OK to stop playing the game because you don't like it anymore. Maybe some of the changes recently made are *slightly* over tuned. But it is clear that Bungie wants to raise the bar on difficulty since we have been power crept to hell and beyond. If you do not like this new challenge/difficult and you want to stop playing, then stop. Games are not tailor made. I did not buy Elden Ring because the game is not for me. If I bought it and didn't like it I would either return it or just not play. I lost some cash which sucks but it happens when to try a game you don't know that you will like. All of this is to say; If you do not like the new challenge Bungie wants to give Destiny, maybe Destiny is no longer the game for you, and that is ok.",31,0,2023-03-29 15:06:23,2023,3

""Why can't we have weapon focusing mods on our ghosts?""

Clown cartridge spec
Rangefinder spec 
Auto-loading etc

The costs of the mods could keep it balanced maybe have barrel and mag in the same ghost slot 

Farming the leviathan in season of opulence was my favorite ""grind"" (if you can call it that) because it never felt like a wasted run with the ability to focus my rewards.

Go even further and let us unlock raid specific mods that allow us to focus precision weapons rapid fire weapons heavy or special from said raid.


Would this take too much away from the looter side of this shooter?

I feel like there's a simple way to balance us focusing our drops/rewards.    I don't want guardians to have to run 72 raids before they find what they're looking for.

Then I went for Malenia last night and she annoyed me. I was fed up with her stupid animation canceling so I put on Radahn's set, got my old Hand of Malenia +9 from my chest, and made a Malenia salad by spamming her own move.

It felt good at the time but now I can't try to git gud and beat her with the Longsword/Square Off anymore in this playthrough.

We're the game's pawns and there's nothing we can do about it. Niantic/TPC doesn't care about us individually, and has no reason to: they've made a game so big that they won't care if a couple thousand people quit due to a bad update, so long as they'll earn hundreds of thousands more players next week. PoGO is not an indie game that relies on its fanbase to make it popular, it's a behemoth of mobile gaming that's still topping the charts, almost 7 years after its release. From what I've heard, it's making more money now than ever before.

pokemongo,Bacteriophag,Remote Raids Disaster - Reasons,"Some time ago I read interview with Steranka done after LV Hoenn Tour event, where he stated what can be basically summarized as the team reluctance towards the fact that people can ""buy legendaries"" from their home, by clicking some button on third party app and joining raid remotely, without ""playing as Niantic intended"".

I've read many comments since yesterday and that awfully full of empty words Niantic's post and conclusion about this whole change and something that I think we all need to understand is:

- Niantic doesn't want the third party apps system of cooperation between people in areas with gyms but no community left (or never been there in the first place) and people in rural areas/unable to participate in in-person raids due to any other reason to work as efficiently as it did for few past years.

- Niantic doesn't want people to farm resources from raids as easily as it was happenning for now.

- Niantic is aware whales will still complete maximum of raids per day with doubled cost so they probably hope this form of revenue from in game sales won't be affected too much.

- Niantic doesn't care at all about part of playerbase that this change will make UNABLE to participate in raids at all - which is so ironic considering Steranka's arguments about reasons of not implementing ""Ready"" button for raid lobbies being that ""it could exclude some players who couldn't participate because others already started raid without waiting 2 minutes"" - what a joke.

- Niantic only cares about GPS data collection so their hope is that players who can't host raids with remote raiders help will travel to areas with more gyms and players, which not only generates more data about travels to new areas but makes people visit more popular areas as well.

My personal experience? If PokeGenie will become less useful due to queues being longer than 200+ lobbies anytime, my raid participation behaviour will go back to 2017-2018 period, meaning simply not doing T5 raids and only completing soloable ones. I feel sorry for anyone who really enjoyed raiding with faraway friends. My suggestion would be to give 1 star and not spend a dime from now on.",3,33,2023-03-31 11:11:59,2023,3

VALORANT,vtt_,dealing with queueing with friends of a lower skill level?,"// to clarify, i mean queueing with friends of a lower skill level, not a lower rank

We all played our placement games together, they all got placed in iron 2, and I got placed at Bronze 1. While this isn't a huge difference in itself, it's a bit of a struggle. In the games I play with them, I'm consistently the match MVP (85%+). I get accused of hacking and smurfing regularly, but that's not the case.

The point of this post is me figuring out how to approach dealing with it. It's gotten to the point where I can land 35-40 kills, 15 assists, and the majority of plants/defuses, and we still lose the game- typically in a 11-13 kinda fashion. 

I'm super supportive of them and never talk down on their performance, I only ever hype them up on their good plays. My issue is that eventually losing after performing at the top of my ability becomes exhausting, and I'm wondering how I can help them improve. I try to teach them game sense and crosshair placement, as well as rotating properly and everything else that comes with competitive FPS, but they just don't seem to absorb it. 

Any advice on how to help them improve outside of some generic ProGuides tier BS is greatly appreciated. Carrying and losing kinda sucks more than a normal loss.",2,1,2021-06-12 22:44:02,2021,6

I think this bug (if I'm not forgotten an important requirement) may be due to the fact that I've completed step 3 of A mythical discovery only a month ago (I'm playing again till one month, stopped to play at the end of 2016).

To spice things up, in FireRed and SoulSilver, I have been playing stuff out of the normal order I play. 

In FireRed I saved Sabrina for after I beat Blaine, and did Blaine as soon as I beat Koga and could Surf. I didn't even touch Silph Co. till after. In SoulSilver I did the Mahogany Town stuff before beating Chuck and Jasmine, while I normally touch them after Jasmine. I have found switching things up to be pretty enjoyable!

So it got me thinking: what order do you like doing these things that can be done out of order? Have you changed the order you play these segments in games (including ones I haven't mentioned!) between playthroughs, and how did you like doing that?",3,1,2021-06-12 22:56:53,2021,6

pokemon,infiltrating_enemies,Opinions on Pokémon go clothes and prices?,"I personally don't mind the style too much, although I would prefer more chunky or thick clothes, like the willow set. They're thin, they're short (short sleeves, cropped trousers, etc), and almost all the good ones are overpriced. One of my favourite sets is the team aqua set, and I spent weeks in gyms to afford it all (at about 200 coins for just the shirt, you can imagine how long that took), then when I changed from a fem avatar to a masc one, I can't access the masc set. I would've thought buying a set meant buying for both avatars, given the prices of the clothes. It's put me off buying clothes at all to be honest, since I don't want to spend 150 coins on a hat or a shirt that I can only use for one avatar. On top of that, the men's trousers are lackluster and leave something to be desired, and the default shorts are just ugly in my opinion, the various level/quest unlocks are better though.

I think I'm biased as an NB person who switches avatars, but if you ask me, the clothes are overpriced and the price should include both sets, or the sets that you buy should be available for both avatars (IE, wearing the fem aqua set on a male avatar). I think niantic is making them overpriced and the default clothes lackluster to make people spend and play more, but I also don't think that's an excuse.

This battle season is the first time I've gotten into tanking through PvP battles, and I've gotta say, I'm having WAY more actual fun (and exponentially more rewards) doing it this way than I ever did actually trying to win/progress legitimately.

I've played this game (with some large time gaps here and there) since literally day one (technically day -1 since there was that like, Australian app file you could use to install it early the night before it released everywhere else, anyone remember that?), and the battle league has always just been kinda ""that aspect of the game that I don't really engage with."" Like, I had/have a competitive team, and had done some battles here and there (like when tasks called for it), but it was always just fighting against whatever the meta was at that time, or battling teams of legendaries, or just, all that crap that made it feel more like a slough than anything enjoyable.

Tanking though, it's made this part of the game something I actually look forward to doing. I've done my 25 daily battles every day since the start of this season, and spent a good chunk of the recent battle day doing more of the same. The reward system Niantic has set-up just isn't great, and feels more punishing to those who don't want to spend their time optimizing their team than just enjoying battling/PvP. But now, with so much less (basically zero sometimes) effort, I've hit rank 20 (a thing I never would have done before), get a ton of stardust and rewards, and receive some (kinda mediocre, honestly) encounters daily.

So yeah, TL;DR: Tanking in Battle League is better than the original system ever was.",1,4,2023-03-31 13:25:13,2023,3

Similar to this issue - [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/vjvo5w/destiny\_2\_makes\_my\_monitors\_turn\_off\_and\_go\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/vjvo5w/destiny_2_makes_my_monitors_turn_off_and_go_on/)  


When I'm playing D2 my game will just randomly lock and my monitor will enter sleep mode. I can hear game music for a bit, but fireteam members say I'm immediately out of game. 

This ONLY happens in D2, no other game, even much newer games.   


I've done all the fixes suggested in the linked thread. Disabled, enabled video card, reset drivers, re-installed D2, reseated video card, changed video card power cables, changed power cable input spot, shut off gsync, limited refresh rate to well under top, etc.   


What can I do? Game is unplayable now. Every other game in my collection plays fine. So I really don't think it's a power supply issue as stated in other thread.

Genshin_Impact,BPlayinMan,Newbie Team Building help,"So, I was a long time Genshin hater until a week ago I thought I'd give it a real try, and I must say that it actually is great.

The point is tho, talking with some friends who have been playing a long time and looking at the character archive, I found out I don't like most of the ""strong"" / ""meta"" characters. So I have some questions for you guys:

1) How much do ""strong"" characters actually matter? One of my favourite things of single player games is that you can play most of the content however you like, without really being forced into specific builds

2) How much should I care for ""perfect"" team building? I mean, if I care for reactions, put in a character for each ""role"" (DPS, support, healer, whatever), do I really have to care that much for perfect combos / compositions?

This is mainly because I have already identified characters I like that I would like to use long-term, and I honestly don't care that much that they are mostly 4-stars (Specifically I just love how Noelle and Beidou feel gameplay-wise)

I know some content requires strong and well designed comps (Spiral Abyss I think), but does it really matter aside from that kind of content?

As a side note, I already have in mind a team I want to build, call it stupid or fucking random built but again, I care about enjoying the gameplay and most of the game is already so fucking easy. The team would be: Beidou / Noelle / Bennett and Dehya or Yae

Yes I know Dehya is kinda shit but hey she looks good, uses a Claymore and reading her abilities looks like she might feel nice to play with

TL;DR: Can I play with whoever I want, even after completing the story, or is pulling broken 5-stars that important?",34,0,2023-03-29 09:11:34,2023,3

Eldenring,Loneliest_Driver,Why is Gransax' corpse still in Leyndell?,"If I get the lore correctly, Gransax attacked Leyndell which started the war against the dragon. During the course of the war, Godwyn befriended Fortissax and the dragon cult got established. This all happened before the shattering and it must've happened quite some time before it, so why didn't they clean up this mess?  


You could argue that the corpse is near impossible to remove and they kept it as a monument but it looks like they did a very bad job at it.   
You climb up his wing into a damaged building. They must've had more than enough time to either fix the building, or change it/tear it down/whatever to make room for the new ""monument"". They just kinda left it there in a damaged state for possibly hundreds or thousands of years which seems rather unreasonable for me.",12,6,2023-03-29 09:27:26,2023,3

Bungie should remove the penalty on the adept mods (that have them), and introduce more adept mods.

Also during RON jumping puzzle with the light and dark shield buff proves that light and dark can safely mix and do what neither of them could do alone

DestinyTheGame,Mace8937,Master nightfalls easier than Legend?,"This week especially with Glassway as the nightfall, and the challenges to get 130k in ~25 minutes for legend and 200k in ~30 for master. Playing both about 5 light levels under the effective level, it just seems like Master is much easier to beat and to accomplish the score restraint.

I’m about 5 runs with random LFGs on Legend we were able to get 130k on only one of those runs and every time going over the time limit before score starts expiring, we also wiped numerous times at the boss stage throughout the runs. 

Doing 3 master runs also with random LFGs, we finished each run around 25-26 minutes in, so about the same speed as legend with no wipes at all. We also hit way over the score restraint each run. There were more champions but for whatever reason they died just as fast if not faster than in legend. The boss seemingly also took about the same amount of damage despite a 10 level different between the two modes.

Neither were enjoyable to slog through, but it just caught me off guard how easy master was comparably to legend.",9,0,2023-03-30 10:32:46,2023,3

Eldenring,murfman713,Any unique weapons good for STR builds? Should I cap STR at 54 and add faith? Or keep pumping STR?,"I have been 2-handing the Gutz Greatsword with strength build. I am about level 80 right now and my sword is +17. I love the Gutz Greatsword but I have all these somber stones sitting in my inventory. I actually have enough stones to bring a unique weapon up to +8 right now. Naturally, that got me thinking, it would be fun to invest the somber stones in something so i have have a secondary weapon to use for fun. I was looking at the bloodhound fang but sadly its strictly a quality-build sort of weapon and I don't want to respec as a quality build would impact the potency of my Greatsword.

On the note of strength builds, I heard i should cap my strength points at 54 due to the 1.5 2-hander buff. Is that correct, or are points truly better spent pumping beyond 54 STR? If the 54STR cap is legitimate, what do most people invest in? I was thinking it might be a decent idea to invest in faith after i hit 54 STR, that way i can get access to buffs.

So, could anyone recommend some strength build weapons that are upgraded with somber stones? I am open to all weapon types, as long as they dont require a respec from strength. As i mentioned, I am open to adding points into faith if 54 is a good cap for STR, so strength/faith weapons are totally on the table if you have one in mind.",2,1,2023-03-14 18:48:11,2023,3

 “act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination”. 

As you can see from the definition, using Chunk Base isn’t cheating. Not only can Bedrock players use this application, but it is in no way unfair. Sure, if you’re having a competition with someone, using it to speed-run, and your opponent doesn’t have access to Chunk Base then yes, it’s cheaty.

Eldenring,Evening_Exchange_591,Help on a replay,"Hey,

I played Elden Ring on launch and made it throughout (all major stuff, included killing Malenia and Mohg 2.0).

While I was one of the idiots who enjoyed the challenge that these late encounters brought, I felt extremely overpowered to the point of not being able to enjoy properly the middle part of the game (I remember most of Liurnia, Raya Lucaria, Altus Plateau, Leyndell + sewers and Mountaintops of the Giants being way easier than Limgrave + Stormveil which I loved).

I think the problem was my damage being way too high, as I was dealing big chunks to the bosses of these areas and I could outtrade and outheal them until I won. (Was playing strength dex build with the Bloodhound's Knife for most of the game).

Is there any resource done such as a leveling cap for each area, weapon +X cap or something like that? I would like to go through most of the big content again but for these bosses to make me learn their patterns.

I know I can just try and level up/ farm if something is too big of a roadblock and I know some people have done RL1 playthroughs,  but still hope that someone found the same issue as I did and put something together.

Then, after we defeat the Boss, we did not receive a guaranteed Red Border from the Puzzle.

Also, the Objective message stuck at, ""Defeat Nezarec"", even if we have access to the Raid Chest.

DestinyTheGame,WellCookedBeefcake,The Case for why Root of Nightmares was meant to be a Dungeon,"Criticisms typically don't go over too well in this sub, so I am braced for the impending downvotes. But if you'll hear me out, have a read:

The planets encounter is the best encounter in this raid, and is also the most different from the remainder of the raid, let's talk about why, using just a few core Destiny raid encounter design principles. The list below is not extensive.

1. Seeing things that other players can't, and communicating this with your team.

- In the planets encounter, you cannot see the other half of planets' alignments. This requires you to communicate with an ally to determine which planet on the other side of the map you'll switch with and vice versa. 

- Other examples of this include the scanner communicating with others throughout DSC, figuring out where to cleanse during Riven, determining the oracle order in Atheon, determining which plate to go to on warpriest, sisters, Oryx, etc.

2. Coordinating with teammates temporally

- When you shift a planet has to take place at the same time that your partner is shifting theirs. You cannot work in isolation to move one planet at a time during separate planetary shifts, and must work together in sync to create spaces for the planets to go to.

- As before, lots of examples of this exist in Destiny raids. The plates you stand on for various reasons in Shuro Chi damage the player, requiring everyone to hop on at similar times. Gambit teams coordinating with the team on the ground to pull them during sanctified mind when they're full up on motes.

3. Coordinating with teammates spatially

- 4 out of the 6 players are each responsible for a unique starting plate, and its mirror on the other side of the map. Each of these players man their position and role, working with their partner to ensure smooth encounter completion.

- Incredibly common too: splitting up into two teams of 3 with rotating roles in totems, 3 teams of 2 for warpriest, designating plates in oryx, splitting up into two teams for morgoth, the relay encounter in garden, literally any tether in garden, etc. etc.

4. Real-time decision making as a group

- Just before starting a damage phase, it must be coordinated who will dunk the corresponding planet on which of the three plates in the middle. You can designate someone to always dunk a light planet and someone else to always dunk a dark, but the odd-one-out always require some on-the-spot decision making and coordination so teams don't double up on dunks or leave a plate open.

- Deciding who will dunk in which receptacle during Descent or Taniks, and who will grab which nukes. Who will cover which plates during the puzzle portion of Shuro Chi, which door everyone will hide in during Kali. Some of these can be premeditated, but they are all open-ended questions require quick, coordinated responses from the team.



How the seed mechanic central to remaining 3 encounters (same size as a dungeon) does not achieve any of the above:

1. You do not need to say anything at all during these encounters. One person can run each type of seed and that's it. Literally no need to mic up or type in chat ever.

2. It does not matter when the seed runner does their job relative to anything else going on (they just have to do it fast enough), it's a completely isolated mechanic temporally.

3. Outside of the forced splitting of players in the second encounter, there is no spatial coordination required by anyone not running a seed. You can be anywhere on the map killing enemies and be effective.

4. There are no moments that requires the team to reconvene and get on the same page for something. The one mechanic that might qualify is when you opt to grab a refuge buff and prevent nezarec's wipe mechanic, but that mechanic is skipped entirely in most cases with people just running their seeds fast enough.

3 out of the 4 encounters of RoN do not have the makings of Destiny 2 raid encounters, and they are also the 3 encounters that share a mechanic. 3 is also commonly the number of encounters in a dungeon. Seed running is also painfully (*painfully*) similar to circuit making in SotW, a dungeon. Coincidence? I think not.",14,13,2023-03-14 23:33:57,2023,3
DestinyTheGame,Lexiconnoisseur,Lost Sectors need an exotic drop rate buff.,"Pretty much the title, I'm actually enjoying the difficulty increase for the majority of activities, but the massive increase in Lost Sector difficulty really needs to have an appropriate increase in rewards.  

Lost Sectors were already somewhat painful for anyone trying to get targeted high roll exotics, and with each new expansion and the occasional season we add more and more exotics to the loot pool.  Back when you could blow through a lost sector in a minute or two it was less of an issue, but now even an experienced player with a good build is going to spend 5+ minutes a run, and when drop rates are this low, you'll typically have an hour pass before you'll even see a _single_ exotic piece, never mind the one you're farming for.

It must feel especially punishing to new players, I have thousands of hours in Destiny, and I've already gotten fantastic rolls from the Lost Sector grinding I've already done over the last few years and even I can't imagine having to start over from scratch, I'd probably just not bother.

I don't care about ascendant shards, or prisms, or cores, I farm Lost Sectors exclusively for exotics, and right now they just aren't worth my time.  50% chance for Legend and 100% chance for Master feels about right to me at this difficulty level, there's still a huge RNG factor in trying to get the exotic that you want with the stats you're looking for.",274,2338,2023-03-14 23:34:31,2023,3

We can see this more clearly in the actual witnesses pyramid ship during the root of nightmares raid.  

If bungie wanted a huge plot twist, this would be a way to do it.  The twist being the hive weren’t actually lied to and the traveler was just coming to use them as another stepping stone to make its tree’s final form (whatever that may be).  It would explain why we hear about the hive and the disciples being so murderous, if they essentially are “glassing” planets infected by the trees the traveler plants.

Eldenring,TransPM,Torrent's former master,"I'm sure I'm way late to this discussion and this point may have already been raised hundreds of times before, but while watching an Elden Ring playthrough I was reminded of some dialogue I haven't bothered to really pay attention to since my first playthrough last year that I don't recall seeing brought up in discussions and speculation about Torrent's former master.

The dialogue I'm referring to comes from Hewg after progressing Roderika's questline to become a spirit tuner:

&gt;""I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. It was all I could do to honour her.""

Roderika is the only spirit tuner we meet, but when we receive the spirit calling bell from Ranni (calling herself Renna) we are told that it was entrusted to her by ""Torrent's former master"". I don't think it's too much of a leap to assume that someone in possession of a spirit calling bell may have been a spirit tuner, and it's possible they may have been the same spirit tuner to whom Hewg owed a debt. We also know that Hewg made a promise to Marika, which he references after smithing a god-slaying weapon. Hewg's debt and promise could be to the same person: Marika.

I know that's a few assumptions in a row to reach that conclusion, and there has been plenty of other evidence supporting the theory that Marika is Torrent's former master, but I believe these bits of dialogue from Hewg are further evidence in support of that.",8,0,2023-03-30 17:58:06,2023,3

Would someone be willing to explain how weapon and ghost mods are *supposed* to work and what the current issue with weapon and ghost mods are? If you use specific terms (loot pool, world drop, world engram, etc) that a new player may not know, it would be helpful if you could also define those.

DestinyTheGame,DTG_Bot,This Week at Bungie - 03/30/2023,"Source: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/destiny-2-twab-3-30-23

---

This week at Bungie, we’re still recovering from the emotional roller coaster that was last week’s story mission and this week’s remembrance centering around Amanda Holliday. While we’re still making our best attempt at pretending we aren't sobbing messes over our favorite mechanic, we did want to share our preview of the mid-Season weapons update, a fun behind-the-scenes look at development animation horrors, and an update on what our Player Support team is working hard on.



Here’s what we’re going to be digging into this week:



* A preview of our mid-Season update from the team.
* Answering a question about one particular weapon players are searching for.
* A behind-the-scenes look at placeholder animations regarding that gun.
* Update from our Player Support team on known issues and coming updates.
* The community’s favorite #AOTW and #MOTW picks of the week.

In case you missed last week’s blog, here’s a helpful TLDR:



* We said farewell to the man behind our beloved Commander, Lance Reddick.
* Shared a quick wrap-up of a recent Crucible blog post.
* Shared some changes to the Root of Nightmares raid.

   * A bonus heads up that Master and Challenge Mode begins *this* week.

You can check out[ last week’s update here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab_03_23_23) to learn more!



Before we move on to the actual TWAB, we wanted to pay tribute to the incredible Amanda Holliday. Last week, we all said goodbye to a character that proudly walked the Guardian path in every way but her title. Holliday gave her life during Season of Defiance, and she did so in the most Amanda way possible: like a compassionate Badass with a capital ‘B.’ No matter her trials, her heart never shied away from caring about those around her, even when her mind begged her to be more reserved. We saw it with her friendship with Crow, and against all odds, we saw it in the small ways she showed our Vanguard that she was there to support them. We also saw it each time we spoke with her, even if we just needed a little ship tune-up.

On a more personal note, I worked on aircraft when I was active duty military, so I always looked up to Amanda as a character and felt a special bond with her. I could see myself in her. I wanted to *be* her. She was a Light and had a strength I don’t even think she knew about. It has always been inspiring, and her journey will continue to inspire long after her sacrifice.



Amanda Holliday gave up her life to help those around her, for those who needed protection. Needed safety. She sacrificed herself for a cause she believed in, and it’s our job as Guardians to make her proud.


##Time For a Difficult(y) Conversation


We've been keeping an eye on community feedback on overall difficulty since Lightfall's launch, and we have some changes in[ today's update](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-hotfix-7-0-0-7) and future updates that retune certain experiences. In today’s update, we’ve reduced Legend and Master enemy HP scalars for non-boss units, which we felt were a little higher than we liked:



* Reduced the enemy HP scalar in all non-raid/dungeon Legend and Master activities by 10%.
* Reduced the co-op enemy HP scalar in Legendary Avalon by 33% in a full fireteam.

We've also made some additional reductions to Commendations requirements so players can reach their milestones at a more enjoyable pace:



* Reduced Hawthorne's weekly challenge Commendations target from 20 to 5.
* Removed Guardian Rank objectives that require players to give Commendations from Ranks 7, 8, and 9.
* Further reduced Commendation score requirements for Guardian Ranks 7-9:

   * Rank 7: 100 (was 460)
   * Rank 8: 250 (was 790)
   * Rank 9: 500 (was 1,290)
##Mid-Season Preview, Weapons Edition


Hello everyone, and welcome to another mid-Season weapons balance pass preview! **Senior Design Lead Chris Proctor** here. This is not going to be a huge one, but we feel that the changes we do have are impactful to the sandboxes in both PvP and PvE. Also, as a note in case you missed it, in last week's patch, we corrected an issue with Target Lock that was making it significantly more forgiving to use than intended, which originally would have been included in this patch, but we felt the change warranted being pulled forward.


####PvE Primary Weapon Balance


We wanted to see how the PvE sandbox shook out after the release of Lightfall, not necessarily to see if primary weapons needed a buff, but more to see how much we should buff them. We've done quite a bit of testing on these numbers, in content ranging from Heroic Nightfalls to Legendary campaigns, all the way up to Grandmasters and we think that the changes are impactful without invalidating the difficulty of the appropriate levels.



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt97a340b559b7e4c6/6425b044af3dfe110c7ed0aa/Iterative_Loop_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OoqpB2z.jpg)

In Heroic and Legendary content, you should be more likely to one-shot red-bar enemies depending on your weapon type, and even in GMs, we have shaved how many shots it takes and time it takes to kill for the below weapons against red and orange bar enemies. We want to add that we do not believe we are done with tuning weapon damage in PvE, this is merely a starting point, and we will revisit it in the coming Seasons to make sure everything has a place in the sandbox.



* Increased the damage of the following weapon types against red and orange bar enemies in PvE:

   * Auto Rifles face steep competition from Submachine Guns (SMGs) within parts of their range, and having a longer possible engagement distance wasn't doing enough to offset it. We don't want Auto Rifles to defeat combatants faster than SMGs, as that would flip the script and invalidate the lower range options instead, but we did feel like we could close the gap substantially.

      * Auto Rifles - 25%
   * Pulse Rifles and Hand Cannons have been considered weaker in harder PvE content for some time, so we wanted to make sure the buff we gave them was substantial, while at the same time keeping them below the lower ranged options in terms of pure lethality. Pulse Rifles have struggled, being less effective than Scout Rifles despite, for the most part, having a less effective range. We also put Sidearms into this group because they similarly lagged in damage output compared to the longer ranged SMGs. At these values, Pulse Rifles should be in a more reasonable spot, Hand Cannons should feel like they pack more of a punch, and Sidearms should fall much better into the ""high risk, high reward"" category.

      * Pulse Rifles, Hand Cannons, and Sidearms - 20%
   * Scout Rifles - We need to be careful tuning Scout Rifles up too much, because they offer the benefits of very safe engagement ranges paired with unlimited ammo, so making them too strong instantly turns most endgame PvE content into ""sit as far away as possible and plink,"" which we want to avoid. That being said, after the changes to the other weapons, they felt like they were trailing just a little too far behind, so we have moved them up as well.

      * Scout Rifles - 10%
* SMGs and Bows - We tuned the rest of the primary weapons using these two archetypes as benchmarks, but as mentioned above, we will continue to keep an eye on the primary weapon balance in PvE and may revisit their tuning as needed.

####Weapon Archetypes


* Submachine Guns

   * Aggressive Frame SMGs have been very strong in the PvP meta for the last couple of months, with a handful of outliers taking most of the credit. The IKELOS SMG was something of a mystery to us, as we continually felt, and got reports, that the gun seemed to have much better stability than its stats would indicate it should, compared to other SMGs. Originally, the IKELOS SMG was built back in the Warmind era when we had fewer guidelines on how to keep weapons balanced, and upon doing a deeper investigation we found that some custom tuning had been added to the weapon's scope to give it a recoil reduction effect. For comparison, the recoil reduction tuning was like having an effect nearly equivalent to Zen Moment at max strength, and always active. We have removed that custom tuning, and the recoil should now feel in-line with other SMGs.

      * IKELOS SMG:

         * Removed some tuning in the custom scope causing these weapons to have significantly less recoil than intended. The recoil is now in line with other Aggressive Frame SMGs.
      * We are aware that this change in isolation, while noticeable, is unlikely to put much of a dent in Aggressive Frame SMGs current dominance, so we have a larger change to reduce the damage of the Aggressives sub-family that will release alongside Season 21. The change will be targeted at shifting the resiliency threshold where the gun can achieve its optimal 0.67s Time to Kill (TTK) down to a lower value, to force a more reasonable 0.77s TTK against most players, while also decreasing their forgiveness of missed crits.
* Fusion Rifle

   * When we last touched Fusion Rifles, Shotguns had seen a big drop in effectiveness, and we were concerned that Rapid-Fire Frame Fusions would rise up to take their place. As such, we preemptively nerfed Rapid-Fires pretty hard. In today's sandbox, this is less of a concern due to the renewed strength of Shotguns following the airborne effectiveness and pellet spread changes, so we have walked back some of the damage nerf we made to Rapid-Fires. This change will push them back to defeating all resilience levels in 7 bolts and give them a decent bump to ease of use.

      * Increased burst damage by 15 (damage per burst goes from 245 to 260, damage per bolt goes from 27.2 to 28.9).
      * Damage in PvE is unchanged.
* Trace Rifle

   * Trace Rifles are in a bit of a precarious spot in the Crucible. In the right hands, they can kill very quickly from long ranges, even outside of their optimal time to kill (TTK). On the other hand, they can be difficult to use, and they often feel heavily ammo limited if you are not hitting the optimal TTK. We did a lot of experimenting with them for this change, including multiple combinations of damage and crit ratios, and settled on the values below as the highest we could push their damage output before they became frustrating to deal with in Crucible. Interestingly, with damage any higher than this the feeling was that they had a surplus of ammo, especially in 6v6 modes, and could often net 2 kills per Special brick picked up, which was concerning. Once we moved their damage values, they still felt like they needed a little bit more, and we wanted to lean harder into making them feel good to use, so we increased the effect that stability has on reducing flinch at the high end of the stat. We will monitor this change when it goes live and may revisit the ammo situation in a future update if their effectiveness remains low.

      * Increased base damage by 4% (base damage goes from 12 to 12.5).
      * Reduced precision hit multiplier from 1.4x to 1.35x (crit damage goes from 16.8 to 16.9).
      * Increased the effectiveness of stability at reducing flinch by 10% at 100 stat (scales down at lower values).
* Sniper Rifle

   * Rapid-Fire Frame Sniper Rifles have long struggled to find a place in both the PvP and PvE meta. In PvP, their inability to kill with two body shots puts them on uneven footing with other Snipers, and in PvE their fast RPM but standard inventory sizes mean you constantly feel low on ammo. To address these concerns and differentiate them from other Sniper sub-families, we have reduced their recoil by 50%. This means hitting crits on a boss or Champion in PvE is much easier, and taking rapid follow-up shots in PvP is too. We have also increased their inventory stat by 30%, which should give them a lot more rounds to play with in PvE content.

      * Reduced recoil by 50%.
      * Increased total ammunition (magazine + reserves) by 30%.

####Exotic Weapons


* Final Warning - Final Warning being able to track targets through barricades, while funny in some cases, felt pretty unfair to play against and was not an intended mechanic of the weapon.

   * Can no longer mark targets through Titan Barricades.
* Tarrabah - This weapon is something we have been keeping an eye on for a while, and with the spotlight being shown on Aggressive Frame SMGs, it felt like Tarrabah has had its time in the sun. When the weapon was introduced, there was substantially less survivability in PvP, and the intention was that it would take nearly two full engagements to get Ravenous Beast active, which made it one of the costliest perk activators we had in game and justified the extreme power it offered. As the sandbox has progressed, however, survivability has increased, and it has become possible for Ravenous Beast to be very close to activating after a single engagement. This has meant that savvy players could purposefully bait or take a small amount of damage (like standing in a grenade's effect) to top off the perk, and then have it active for the second engagement. The increased ease of access has made Ravenous Beast an outlier in today's Crucible, and we were left with the options of reducing the potency of the perk itself or trying to make its activation more difficult, and we decided to work with the latter. This reduction in energy granted from taking damage puts the onus back on the user to deal damage and shifts the balance of the perk back towards a difficult activator that justifies its reward of a potent effect. In addition, we are continuing our mission to address zoom outliers, and this felt like a good time to reduce the zoom of Tarrabah back down to something more in line with the rest of the SMG archetype.

   * Reduced the amount of Ravenous Beast energy generated when taking damage from 3% to 1%.
   * Reduced zoom from 16 to 15.
* Revision Zero - Fourth Times the Charm (FTTC) working when Revision Zero went into Hunter's Trace is a fun and intended interaction, but it caused some unfortunate issues. Activating it too early while the perk was up caused the weapon to overflow its limited mag size and return to the normal Pulse Rifle mode. We have made a fix so that FTTC can continue to work while Hunter's Trace is active, but it will not be able to grant ammo until all shots have been expended. This means you can still enjoy the 2 free shots provided by the perk as long as you hit all 4 Hunter's Trace rounds without worrying about being kicked out of the mode. In addition, we have buffed the damage of the Hunter's Trace rounds by 25% in PvE, and we have buffed the Häkke Heavy Burst rounds by 75% in PvE. This will now make it more of a tradeoff when choosing between the origin perks, either dealing more damage in the primary mode but charging Hunter's Trace more slowly or dealing less damage but charging the bonus shots more quickly.

   * Fourth Times the Charm will now be reset when entering Hunter's Trace.

      * This will prevent the issue of firing a single shot while in Hunter's Trace and being forcibly returned to Pulse Rifle mode when FTTC activates.
   * Increased PvE damage of the Hunter's Trace rounds by 25%.
   * Increased PvE damage of the Häkke Heavy Burst rounds by 75%.[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/I74mm8m5gyg)
####At Season 21 Launch


* A sweeping rework of weapon hip fire reticles to better display useful information to players (accuracy, aim assist, charge state, Exotic perk state, etc.).
* The Aggressive Frame SMG nerf.
* A 10% PvE buff to Sniper Rifle damage.
* Buffs/adjustments to more than a dozen Exotic weapons, including Graviton Lance and Salvation's Grip.
####In the Future


* We are going to be taking a look at how zoom interacts with damage fall off, and the base damage fall off ranges of all weapons in general.
* Zoom, and perks like Rangefinder that manipulate zoom, have become a requirement on several weapon types, either to compete at all in the sandbox, or to allow the weapon to exceed its intended engagement ranges. This has led us to begin to consolidate zoom values on certain weapon archetypes, which removes an important lever that we can use to modify weapon feel, given the effect zoom has on field of view, recoil reduction, and aim assist falloff.
* We will be investigating decoupling damage falloff from zoom (this would be paired alongside a refresh of the base damage falloff values to compensate), which should allow us to better control the engagement ranges of individual archetypes, while at the same time letting us continue to use zoom as a tuning knob for weapon feel without dramatically changing their performance.
##The Case of the Missing Khvostov, A Peek Behind the Developer Curtain


**Cinematics Director James Myers** has an answer that many of you have been asking: “Where the heck is the Khvostov weapon seen in cutscenes?!” Funny story about that, we’ll let Myers take this one.



**Myers**: During the production of Lightfall, *a certain story beat* was pitched related to reluctantly aiming a weapon, and we quickly realized that we would need to animate that moment much more specifically than we typically handle Guardians pointing weapons in previous scenes. Many players have noticed some of the sillier results in some real-time scenes, even when we avoid extreme poses (like our Guardian holding a Bow at the end of The Witch Queen.) So, I spun up a thread with the studio leads and suggested that we decide on a “default weapon” that we could feature if we ever needed something specific like this. I suggested the Khvostov because it’s the very first weapon every player receives in Destiny. Literally every Guardian has tinkered around with this weapon, so it felt like the right call.



At the same time, new systems were being developed that would feature Guardians (like Commendations), and similarly, there were a lot of visual bugs popping up with certain weapons like Glaives and Bows. The animation team was stretched thin closing on cinematics, and a new set of animations was, unfortunately, something that would cost us other content. Because of that, we made the decision to use the same default logic in the instances where a visual bug would detract from the quality bar we aim to achieve.



Regarding helmets seen in in-engine cinematics, I have seen some folks post screenshots of their Guardians from recent real-time cinematics, and many were helmetless! Something we started doing in Lightfall is respecting the player's choice of helmet or no helmet in real-time scenes, where appropriate (we'll keep your helmet on in the vacuum of space for example). But for the most part, if you choose ""hide helmet,"" you'll see your Guardian's face. And if you don't, you won't unless there's a special exception (I don't want to make that promise too airtight, just in case!). There is one caveat to keep in mind: the Season 20 cinematics were in production before we finalized this plan, so from Season 21 onward this will be consistent!



As a little bonus “sneak peek,” some animators in the film industry were[ recently discussing](https://twitter.com/Tonymation/status/1633239873992953856?s=20) how they push animation poses in ridiculous ways to get the framing *just right* on camera, making for better shot composition and framing. It stirred up some interesting conversation, so we figured we'd show you one of these reframings with an example from the Season 20 intro cinematic. Whatever it takes to get the shot, y’know?

##There Will Be Wallpapers


And because you all had to see the hidden horrors of animation right alongside us, here are some freebie wallpapers to enjoy as a return to normalcy. You know, as a treat. Plus, can we just take a moment to drool over the Mara art? Because *definitely* going to snag that one for my new background.

DestinyTheGame,WellCookedBeefcake,Striking the Difficulty Balance: The Key Issues,"With Bungie increasing the difficulty of the game accross the board, and now reducing it, it's clear that sweeping difficulty changes are not what this community wants. The general sentiment is that people want high-end gameplay to be appropriately difficult (e.g. contest mode and master raids, and GMs), and low end content to be easy enough to not require good gear setups which newer players might not have (e.g. neomuna patrol).

In a variety of content, players are unsatisfied with ""difficulty"" being brought in the form of bullet-sponge enemies. If an enemy is dangerous, you're gonna take cover from them whether it's over the course of a few shots or multiple magazines. Bullet-sponges make things a slog, which is great for Bungie's playtime metrics, but not so great when it reduces enjoyment and activity engagement.

I won't get into RoN and raids and mechanical difficulty cuz that's been discussed enough imo.

The key bits:

Where this difficulty talk and changes really got set in motion was with battlegrounds last season. What made battlegrounds so enjoyable and well-regarded was that they occupied \*a unique difficulty niche\*, somewhere between the base strike playlist and legend activities. They weren't great just because they were more difficult, but because they broke down the \*very coarse\* difficulty scale in this game, and made it a little bit finer. There's already very little different going from Legend to Master to GM, but the jump from Strikes to Legend is huge. Battlegrounds helped fill that glaring gap.

The other thing that made battlegrounds fun, is that:

They allowed players to witness the full power of their builds\*

That's what people liked from it, and generally want from content. In the lowest end content, things die so fast that you often don't get to witness all the intricacies of your current build or fully take advantage of your class/subclass. In higher-tier content, things can die so slowly that you similarly often can't get into your build's gameplay loop (especially if it has ""on-kill"" requirements/activations). Players enjoy getting to witness their build's full potential, and last season's battlegrounds allowed that, without requiring the careful positioning that high-tier content asks.

TL:DR

The game does not need sweeping difficulty changes. It needs a challenging high-end, accessible low-end, and a much more gradual increase in difficulty between the two. No one likes a bullet sponge red bar. Everyone likes having some select-able level of difficulty or activity exist in game where they can properly have fun with their build.",72,58,2023-03-30 18:05:43,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,FatherDoggo,"Destiny 2: Show, Don't Tell"," 

As a Destiny veteran who's been playing for 9 years like many of you, I feel qualified to talk about one of the franchise's main glaring issues. And that is its constant insistence upon telling the players rather than showing.

Destiny’s gameplay is unmatched, whereas the quality of the story is inconsistent. When the two merge, to display the story through the gameplay is when the game is at its weakest. Here are some examples of what I mean:

Sagira’s death is relayed to us during the loading screen dialogue during the first mission of the season of the Hunt. Self-explanatory. 

The final mission of the season of the Hunt has Crow and us going in and out of the ascendent realm except Crow always swaps with us when we exit and enter. This just felt bad. It felt like a shortcut the game devs made so that they didn’t have to show or animate Crow which would make this mission better and feel more immersed. 

These are two old examples, and two more recent examples are:

The opening mission of Lightfall where we are put into a Cabal drop-pod and played audio of landing in it in a janky “cutscene.” 

The final mission of Lightfall where we fight those hoards of enemies and then are told to go to the Veil (a whole nother issue) while Caiatl deals with her father. I \*want\* to see the fight, not be told about it or played audio which I can only imagine what is going on outside. 

Bungie is a multi-billion dollar company, and these examples of laziness are inexcusable. These are only the immediate ones that came to my mind however, there are many more.

I also find it very ironic judging by how both the Veil and the thing that the Witness did at the end of Lightfall. These are examples of what happens when Bungie shows, but refuses to tell, for seemingly no reason. The examples of this are few and far between but I still find it quite comical how a multi-billion dollar company that created the great Witch Queen story last year can simultaneously tell too much and show too little about the things we want to see, and show too much and tell too little about the things we want to be told. 

As to not rag on the story team I’d like to show when these were done well:

Just the entirety of Forsaken. Probably the best expansion that’s ever been put out for Destiny. I know blah blah blah rose-tinted glasses but it is objectively the most well-rounded piece of content we’ve ever gotten. 

Season of the Drifter I really liked in terms of story. This might just be personal bias because I love going against the constant do-gooder guardian status quo, I love flawed characters and Drifter is just that. 

Season of the Haunted’s emotional storytelling was immaculate, going further in-depth and giving character development to previously established characters (what Shadowkeep should have been more about IMO). 

The Witch Queen had great questions and satisfying answers all contained within the campaign.

And TBF Lightfall did have some very interesting concepts and questions, just none were executed well or answered. I was intrigued with what the Veil is, I was intrigued with what the Radial Mast was (I assumed it was like one of those power suppressors but larger because of the similar design), and I was intrigued by the Witness’ motivations, but none of these were answered or explained in a full-priced DLC.",15,0,2023-03-30 18:12:58,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,PM_SHORT_STORY_IDEAS,"Commendations Need a soft reset, and the community would be just fine with it","Per today's hotfix, commendations went from being a primary timesink for guardian ranks, to basically another checkbox that won't gatekeep progress at all. They have effectively been removed from ranks, which means aside from the pinnacles (which was far less of an issue, and should be going away as people reach pinnacle cap) they're purely the cosmetic measure that they always should have been.

It still needs work to transition it into something that represents what it should: recognizing people for special effort

**Suggestion 1: Let us gift the same commendation to multiple people.**   
If I run a fun raid and I'm in stiches the entire time, am I going to make sure I find which commendation fit everyone the most? Heck no, I want to rate everyone as 'fun loving', and maybe give the leader one to the guy who carried DPS and made sure we got through the raid. Let us do that, now that it's cosmetic only.

**Suggestion 2: add a basic commendation with multi-award functionality.**  
Call it team player, so that there's a baseline to make the other  commendations special. Right now they're just different colored M&amp;Ms. Imagine if 70% of M&amp;Ms were green though: you'd care about the other ones a lot more

**Suggestion 3: have commendation options than total players.**  
These commendations already exist, they just aren't available on every screen. This would help emphasize that its not just about which player gets which M&amp;M, but that, if desired, some thought can be put into the commendations. This could eventually make certain commendations more or less rare, which would actually be interesting to gameplay.

That's all. Hope this system can go somewhere healthy after it's rocky start.",3,0,2023-03-30 18:17:12,2023,3

Second: is there anything that I can do to reduce the latency issue? As someone who loves this game and Loves PvP in general. Im quite disappointed to find the same issues that have been in souls game from the beginning.

DestinyTheGame,TehSavior,SBMM playlists supposedly have an exploit that lets you manipulate lobbies to get matched with low skill players. There's an easy way to protect yourself though.,"From what I've heard, the way the exploit works is you make a fireteam with yourself and a low rating smurf account, let the game matchmake you to a full lobby, then have the smurf leave your fireteam when it hits 12/12

To protect yourself against having to play these matches, drop out of queue if you see a game that when it hits 12/12, drop to 11/12 and refill back to 12/12

The reason it supposedly works is your fireteam skill is averaged between yourself and the other members of your fireteam. So by letting a match fill up while your average is being tanked by your alt account, then leaving on the alt, you end up guaranteeing yourself a lobby full of players who are below your skill rating because the people who are getting matched with you are being calculated based on your artificially lowered skill rating.

Remember, keep an eye on the lobby size when matching into games, if it's got fluctuations at 12/12, you've probably got someone trying to be clever in the lobby. 

I feel like a good temporary fix would be that if you're in matchmaking, and someone leaves your fireteam, it should just cancel matchmaking for the rest of the team, in order to prevent balance manipulation.

At least it wasn't telesto this time.",4,0,2023-03-29 09:52:11,2023,3

I decided to replay the final Shadowkeep quest, Beyond, since the final cutscene shows our Guardian being the most expressive and emotive I think they've ever been. However, after picking up the Unknown Artifact, I was just sent back to orbit. So, is there no way to rewatch that cutscene? If not, are there any other good places I can see my Guardian's face? Apparently that one Lightfall campaign mission with the Strand training montage scene (I forget the mission's name) actually shows your Guardian's face if you have your helmet toggled off, but I'm not sure how good that scene would be for art reference.

EDIT: I tried the Lightfall mission, it's called Headlong btw. I'd say it was good enough for my purposes, although I still wish I could rewatch the Shadowkeep cutscene the same way. All you have to do to rewatch the Headlong cutscene is replay the mission. However, make sure your helmet is toggled off, if it's not then your Guardian will still have their helmet on in the cutscene. Also, physics can get a little weird in it, a couple of times my robes freaked out and stretched into oblivion. But otherwise it was good reference material.",6,6,2023-03-29 09:59:16,2023,3

Genshin_Impact,DoomCameToSarnath,Possible new weapons in the future.,"So I was wondering earlier if Genshin plans to bring in any new weapon archetypes for future characters. Given we're only on the 4th of Seven continents not including any potential time or space shenanigans, that leaves us with a massive roster of future characters with the possibility of staleness coming to the classes. For example, with Ganyu every future Cryo Archer will be judged against her.  


So I thought some new, different weapons might be an idea.   


First idea: Chakrams.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuUlYOK40\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuUlYOK40_M)

&amp;#x200B;

A medium range weapon that was shown in Kingdoms of Amalur, it would be an intriguing weapon given its focus on rapid strikes between bow and melee range. As seen in the video, elemental aspects could be included with the chakrams serving as a vehicle for Vision use.  


Second idea: Whips  


An idea I postulated a long time ago in regards to Dendro, it could lend itself very well to a vampiric type of combat. A whip of jagged thorns slashing into enemies and healing the user with the enemies...life essence, shall we say.  This is just one idea mind you, and could easily fit in to a more ""restraint"" oriented build, such as slowing or pinning an enemy to be hit by another characters Burst. Keeping an enemy in Shenhe's burst for example. On larger enemies it would function more as a slow than a bind though.

&amp;#x200B;

Third idea: Sai

&amp;#x200B;

A very fast attack weapon used in both hands, would focus primarily on pin-point attacks or crippling slashes. Lower damage than swords, but making up for it with sharp dps increase coupled with effects to control enemies. Eye slash, artery piercing, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth idea: Mace/ Morningstar

&amp;#x200B;

The morningstar being the less friendly version of the mace, it would specialize in anti-armor and knockbacks. The morningstar would be the opposite and be brilliant for unarmored enemies. Plus it has some overt ties in to Genshin mythology. With Paimon and some of the other characters bearing names of demons, Morningstar, or Lucifer as he is more commonly known...well, obvious allusion is obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously Genshin isn't going to take my suggestions ,as I am just some rando on the internet. Anyone else have any more interesting ideas?",12,0,2023-03-29 10:10:38,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,sterrerwert,"Most optimized DPS setup possible. (or not, le's talk about it)","*So here's my take on the best Raid dps setup that should theoretically be possible in the game rn:*

**First of all Guardians: 4 Warlocks, 2 Hunters**

\- The 4x Warlocks should run Starfire - all four should also have Well equipped as their Super.

\- 1x Hunter should run Bakris (\~21% bonus Arc dmg) - Duskfield Grenades / Whisper of Impetus for reloading are optimal.

\- 1x Hunter can run anything really to increase his neutral game. (If he's funny, he can use Foetracer, since it increases dmg output slightly in the long run XD)   
*- Alterantively he could use Moebius Quiver instead of Deadfall and stagger his Tethers with Star-Eater for a longer debuff &amp; good additional dmg.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Weapons and optimal usage:**

\- 1x Gjallahorn - best utilized by the Void Hunter - here to provide Wolfpack rounds to everyone - and obvioulsy provde a debuff via Tether.

\- 1x Bump in the Night - best utilized by one of the Warlocks - Demo / Chill Clip -&gt; to maximize Shatter dmg - I'd also give this Warlock a Witherhoard, with the intention of hitting direct hits on the boss.

\- 1x Hothead, specifically with Demo / Vorpal - there is currently a bug, where an Osteo Striga d.o.t will self-refresh when you switch t a Vorpal wepaon (Osteo d.o.t is actually stronger than Witherhoard too btw) - best utilized by the Bakris Hunter - obviously this Guardian would have Osteo Striga equipped and is a prime candidate to also use something like Prodigal Return to apply a decently strong Jolt considering, there are ads present before dps starts to proc Voltshot.*This should overall be more dmg than a Two-Tailed-Fox Jolt, since you surpass the added dmg of its stronger Jolt due to the higher dmg output via Wolpck Rounds.*

\- 3x Hotheads with Demo / Lasting Impression - best used by the 3 reamining Warlocks.*- 1x Warlock should also use Witherhoard and hit the floor with the pool, since d.o.ts don't stack, but you can have both a pool and a direct hit for Witherhoard.- 2x Warlocks should use Lumina, to provide everyone with the strongest wepaon buff available and I specifically have 2 Warlocks using it to provide some forgiveness here. Alternatively 1 could still use IZI.*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:**

I specifically tried to avoid any overlaps here, especially in regards to the 3 usable d.o.ts of Osteo Striga, Witherhoard &amp; Jolt. Ignitions should basically perma proc due to Fusion Nade spam and the same goes for Shatters with a Wolfpack Rounds buffed Bump and an Ice Nado / Duskfield on the boss. The only thing not utilized is Volatile, so maybe thorwing in a Bad Herring (field prep / Lasting) and replacing one of the Hotheads might actually be a decent idea, though I'm not quite sure if it would even improve the dmg output.

So overall you'd get the best debuff via Tether, the best buff via Lumina (and obviously using your respective surge mods), basically max utilization of any and all d.o.ts and subclass effects + all of that while making the most of Wolfpack rounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I miss anything? Any suggestions to improve this theoretical optimal setup? Any thoughts about it in general? I'm eager to hear your thoughts / talk about it in the comments.",8,0,2023-03-29 10:19:07,2023,3

VALORANT,mg-jm,New Agent Idea,"Name: Jyro (Assassin of the Shadow)

Playstyle: Duelist

Cursed Art: Inaudible Steps - Becomes invisible for 0.75 second gaining slight movement speed by 55%, silence all steps and Jyro cannot use anything during this period. (2 use) (C)

Cursed Art: Affliction - Upon activation the first 5 bullet will transform into deadly bullets, each bullet will inflict bleeding for 2 seconds dealing 1 dmg per second (stackable, bleeding only affects hp). Affliction will apply when tagging the enemy in any circumstance (e.g. wallbang). Affliction only last for 30 seconds. If Jyro activates Affliction on the gun that he currently use but swaps to another gun this effect will only apply to the gun that was used in activation. Each cooldown is 12 seconds (2 use) (Q)

Cursed Art: Shadow Knife - Throws a knife at the enemy dealing 20 dmg (only effects hp), applying slight slowness (20%) and bleeding dealing 5 dmg per second (bleeding only affects hp) until they remove the knife that takes 1 second to remove. 2 kills lets you reuse the ability, if they bleed to death or killed from the knife you can reuse the ability too. (1 use) (E)

Forbidden Art: Shadow Assassination - When Jyro activates his ult he will create a ring that shows the radius of his attack as he unleashes his blade from the shadow (this animation takes 0.5 second). He will use a slash attack that deals 100 dmg in the radius (after his animation). During his ult he will evade all attacks from the enemies. After he attacks he will teleport behind his ult position (7 meters away) depending which way he faced during activation and he no longer evades attacks (This teleportation is helpful for Jyro to escape from combat). He cannot use any guns or utilities in this phase, he is only able to use his utils and gun once he teleports (there will be an animation that will last for 0.5 second before being able to shoot). (6 ult points) (X)

DestinyTheGame,HopBatman72,Mantle of Battle Harmony builds - leave your suggestions here please,"Just got this exotic to drop and was wondering what builds you guys are using. Off the top of my head I went Void top tree with Graviton Lance. Using Elemental Ordnance with Elemental Charge - these two combined with stacks on stacks, supercharged mean every well I pick up instantly makes me 4x Charged with Light. High energy means huger damage but I’m unsure if this combines with the Mantle’s extra damage? 
Not sure how viable this build is as I haven’t the glimmer to get max Discipline just yet. Top tree void means I can get grenade back faster with a melee hit so hopefully I can get grenade kills often?
Anyway - would love a critique of this build from someone more in the know than I am.

VALORANT,marciedaff,Playing unrated to improve your play but ended up being abused by a player,"I know that everyone have already experienced bullying and trash talk in gaming and I just wanna talk about this because I am really frustrated since this was my first time being yelled at on UNRATED game. I'm playing at SEA servers and I always play Unrated because I'm fully aware that I'm not that good to play Compe consistently(I'm S2 btw) and I wanted to improve my play.

During unrated games I'm used to players trashtalking me on chat because it's really normal. But when it's a voice chat this is where I would literally breakdown and wanting to quit but I would still stay because I don't want be penalized. I know you can mute them, and it helps but what happened to me is before I mute him of course I had to hear first what he has to say right? I mean I really didn't expect he would yell abusively with full speed 😫.

Anyway, while he was swearing and yelling at me our team started an ff surrender, everyone agreed, it was 4-6(score) that time it wasnt yet a half game and this guy started swearing at me because I was too slow to double peek and I'm a low frag 💔. He literally yelled at full speed until the FF scene I heard everything he said and my chest started to feel heavy my heart was beating so fast I was completely about to cry, literally ( i know it's emotional but it was my first time ok?) and it's unrated omygod 😭  

I'm starting to think not to play competitive for now because this might happen again and it's hard to mute players on compe because infos are necessary and I don't want to leave the game knowing my teammates invested so much time on their rank so maybe I will just take break for now.

I know that swearing  really do help to let off some steam but you don't have to yell at them and tell them that they r dumba$$ over and over again, I bet they already know that they are playing bad. Or you can just swear without telling them directly, turn off your mic and yell. I live in the Philippines and the swear in here is really.. i don't know it's painful to hear lmao xD maybe because the tone of every syllable.

Criticizing my play is very very fine with me, some players would tell me what I did wrong or how stupid my play was but at the same time they would tell me how will I resolve it even if they said it to me harshly it's completely fine and normal but yelling threats, violent reactions, offensive language, emotional abuse? you could see how different the two are.

PS. I already sent a ticket on valorant about the player and how I wish i couldve turned on my shadow play but I always turn it off because it lows my FPS. I would've share the clip.",22,8,2021-02-23 06:25:55,2021,2

DestinyTheGame,The7thSloth,'Contacting Destiny 2 Servers',"Alright. So I live in Australia and the servers on pc for some reason here, at least for me, have been terribly bad for the past couple of days. To the point where I can't play the game due to it constantly kicking me out of matches and strikes, always bugging out and teleporting enemies, and not letting me properly interact with the worlds environment or my menus. I checked my internet and connection many.. Many times.. It's not my end unfortunately. Because if it was I'd be able to fix it. Was wondering if anyone else has this issue?

It's just unfortunate because after getting back into D2 for only 2-3 days after a long break of the game, just to see this, is honestly unsurprising and reminds me of why I stopped playing this game in the first place, as much as I love it. Lucky I held back on the season pass to see if the situation would improve, otherwise I would've felt scammed. Bungie if you fix your game you get more of my money. Simple. Right..?

pokemon,AndrewTheMandrew13,Does anyone else hate the special attention Rotom is getting recently?,"(Mobile formatting bad)
This is one of my few problems with the recent games that I don't see talked about that often. When I found out there would be a Rotom pokédex in SM, I was thrilled because this was obviously a direction the series had never gone in before. Obviously it was a bit annoying at times, but it got better in USUM with Roto Loto. It when it appears in Sword and Shield that I started to despise it. In SWSH, a Rotom just shows up with no explanation and decides to become your pokédex all of the sudden. And that's another problem, the pokédex. It could have been an interesting new design based on the design of the Switch (since most pokédexes are based on the console they're released on), but instead, it's just a bland ass phone. So anyway, not only is Rotom in your pokédex for no reason other than it happened in the last gen, but he's also in the pokémon center P.C., as well as your bike??? For all the special attention Rotom is given, I just don't understand why now of all times?",8,9,2021-02-23 06:46:52,2021,2

Genshin_Impact,Taz6846,Need halp with rotation optimization!,"Hi travellers, 

Ive managed to somehow pull both shenhe and ayaka without opening my wallet and have wanted to build an ayaka burst hypercarry for some time. Ive got my team, ive got them more or less built apart from optimizing artifacts and their BiS weapon which im still currently trying for but im trying to figure out the best possible rotation.

Sucrose with TToDS and viridescent

Mona with TToDS and Noblesse

Shenhe with Primoridial spear (highest atk wep i have for her atm) and ToM

Ayaka with Mistsplitter and BS.

My reasoning here is that everyone and everything is specifically to help Ayakas burst, nothing more. TToDS on both catalyst users afaik will be able to pump shenhe and the other to pump ayaka at the same time if thats how it works, noblesse and ToM to help her - i know ToM isnt really anything but its better than any other artifact set to bang on her that i can see to specifically help Ayaka, viridescent for shred, mona for the freeze for the burst crit rate from strayer. Ive banged 3x attack artifcacts on shenhe and am just under 8k attack. My question is amongst all this mess, what is the optimal rotation to maximize on all of these bonuses? 

its a LOT of thought to line up all the different bonuses to make sure shenhe pumps as much as physically possible, the shred gets the most uptime and all artifact bonuses get as much uptime as possible. Is this a real unco team or am i fairly on point here? Sucrose as i dont have Venti or Kazuha, mona is probably my best hydro applier as no kokomi. and shenhe is a must obviously. 

Any advice for this genshin noob is appreciated. TIA",4,0,2023-03-30 13:28:38,2023,3

Just something to consider. It would be great if we could get multiple artifact pages. So we don't have to go in and change up the active artifact mods every time we are switching builds/subclasses. 
Each build page would save the current artifact mods selected.

Eldenring,BitchKing_,Who Commander O'Neal/Niall serves,"Hi,

I was wondering whom does Commander O'Neal/Niall serves. I think (speculation) that these commanders used to serve the old Storm king of Stormveil (similar to the banished knights). I think this because of their (rot/freeze) wind attacks. Those can also be seen in the attacks of the banished knights and soldiers. The rot and freeze status effects of their attacks are in my opinion due to the areas they are present in and not inherently built into the attacks themselves. Secondly, the cape of the commanders are very similar to those of the banished knights in castle sol.

Let me know if anyone has any alternate ideas on this. Happy to hear your views on this.",18,3,2023-03-30 13:41:20,2023,3

They can't return to boss encounters where the mechanics damage the enemies as they just don't feel good to play.

They can't make an excuse for The Witness being weaker or going easy on us like they did for Nezarec and Rhulk.

I feel like the only way they can make The Witness be the most powerful enemy we've seen is to make multiple raid boss encounters where you're fighting The Witness.

Minecraft,Illustrious_Panda561,low FPS bug,"Hi there,

I have a high-end gaming laptop with an RTX3070ti and Ryzen 7 6800H.

First I thought my low fps was because i used the intergrated GPU. After I mannualy changed my GPU i still got a lower fps then i should get on my setup.

I tried everything I could think of for several hours a day the last week with lots of research tweeking al kinds of ingame and PC settings but I havent been able to succeed.

I get around 65 FPS with all fancy settings and render distance on 10. 

Of course 65 FPS is totally playable but according to some online benchmarks I found, I should get at least 400 fps.

The reason i need more FPS is because I'd like to play with shaders.

It doesnt matter what minecraft version I used. I tried 1.19 all the way down to 1.14. 

3rd party launchers and mods dont help either. Neither does:

\-  reïnstalling and updating my drivers.

\- Switching minecraft and javaw.exe from preffered graphics card

\- allocating more ram

\- a lot more that i've tried but forgot about

pokemongo,pvssyonthechainwax,Niantic Needs Feedback,"This morning I emailed the company and complained about the raiding updates. As an able-bodied person, the changes do not effect me much other than my pockets. But for disabled people, it’s a direct attack and exclusion from the game. Disabled people are already limited on how they’re able to play the game, by capping the remote raids and upping the prices, almost completely ruins the game. Any more updates like this and they’ll be cut out completely. 

I would encourage fellow players who are unhappy with the updates to spam Niantic with emails explaining how the updates are designed with ableism in mind. Even if the company doesnt change the prices and cap back, Niantic needs to be considering the disabled community when making updates to the game.

Most o these theory I've seen on twitter/youtube and when you compile them together they make so much sense.

1) this one is a popular one. It's about the writing on the large statue of venti. It's written on the statue's base ""gateway to celestia"" which is obviously odd

2) all of the archons have gnosis in the shape of chess pieces and venti has the gnosis of the queen. In chess the queen is the most versatile piece and can be considered ""strongest"". Which is ironic since he says that he is weakest among the seven",6,3,2023-03-31 12:47:29,2023,3

Eldenring,JordiRapture,What's your not-so-typical wishlist for the DLC?,"We all want Miquella and Godwyn to appear, a lot of us want to see weapon catalysts, and so many other things that have been said in this subreddit countless times. But I'm curious to know what do you want from the DLC that hasn't been said yet! Either in the DLC itself, in the base game, quality of life improvements, etc!

Here's what I would love to see:  
1. Photo mode! I know it's unlikely, but I'm tired of having to play offline and be careful with not being banned when I just want to take pretty screenshots of this amazing game and share them!  
2. A Legacy Dungeon as complex and deep as Stormveil Castle.  
3. Scythes that scale with INT, maybe a boss weapon? (More torches than scythes in base game wtf 😭). My first playthrough was DEX/INT and I'm an avid scythe user, so I was quite sad to see there was no INT scythe in the game!  
4. The third type of Godskin that was rumored to be in Farum Azula instead of the Duo.  
5. A talisman that slowly restores FP (like Blessed Dew).  
6. Being able to downgrade weapons.  
7. More Deathblight weapons.  
8. Let us repeat boss fights as many times we want, no rewards needed. I'm not even asking for a boss rush mode, I just want to repeat a boss fight as many times as I want after defeating it!
9. Let us ride Torrent in the Elden Beast fight, come on.

Copium Ahead:

10. Add new little areas to every base game region. Give some meaning to all these closed doors that we all wonder where they lead to (Lit door next to Elphael Inner Wall, for example. I know there are more but I can't recall now. Tell me if you know of any!). Basically introduce new secrets to discover in the base game.  
11. For the base game, make Melina appear every time you want to level up, or simply be standing next to the grace when she's got something to say. I'd love her to be visible in every grace we discover (at least the first time) doing random things, like the Emerald Herald in DS2.  
12. More irregular terrain PVP arenas, like the ones in Dark Souls 3. Colosseums are nice but they're just a flat round arena.  
13. Since only two great runes are required to beat the game and the other 4 are optional, make the DLC be slightly different or have little changing details depending on which ones you have obtained or activated when entering it.  
14. Reuse the least amount of enemies possible, or at least change their appearance just like eagles are white and trolls are yeti-like when they are in the Mountaintops.",0,2,2023-03-31 12:52:35,2023,3

VALORANT,Psychological-Bat687,Tips if you're new and learning,"So I was 3 stacking the other day with two other friends and was paired with a raze and sage who were faily new (judging by their overall gameplay). 
There were a few times I asked for a heal, politely, nothing, but in game chat again, nothing. They got my friend killed by opening one of the doors when the whole enemy team was in the other side. 
Asked a few other times for heals ...nothing. 
Not one Rez in round one but didn't flame them or anything cos it's unrated fgs. 
In round 2 same thing, they rezzed a raze who was afk and then immediately died and tbh it was in the wide open. 

They then decided to send a message to the enemy team, baffled I asked them why they muted us and why no heals? They went onto explain they prefer it as they are new and don't want toxic ppl talking to them, I kindly explained no one's being toxic and just to do the bare minimum as your character requirement as a healer and to help the team win. 
After that they were fixed in their ways and left them to it. 

I'm all for helping newbies but from how I see it you're not doing any favors muting your team, you restrict any help or comms from your team which is very important in the game also not everyone is a dick, most want to help and you can ask them for help, if you try. 

My advice for new ppl is don't mute your entire team at the start UNTIL you get going if they are being toxic just mute that/those individual/s NOT the whole team cos you're then putting your team at a potential detriment.

Minecraft,Few_Pool_181,What is your opinion on the Replay Mod only supporting Fabric after 1.14?,"I know that many developers find it more convenient and better optimized to develop mods using Fabric. This is also why the official team of the Replay mod only supports the Fabric version after Minecraft 1.14. I fully understand why they choose fabric from a dev's perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

However, from the perspective of content creators, the fact that the Replay mod only supports the Fabric version could greatly limit Minecraft content creation.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people have watched videos such as ""survived 100 days in hardcore Minecraft zombie apocalypse"" created using the Zombie Apocalypse modpack. The camera shots in these videos are not limited to the first or third person view of the game player, but have free and planned camera angles that use the Replay mod to capture footage, which can provide better immersion for the audience.

&amp;#x200B;

Although many developers have been porting Forge mods to the Fabric version, the number of Fabric mods, especially massive-content mods, is still far fewer than those available on Forge. Many of the videos using the Replay mod for filming on Minecraft 1.14 or above are time-lapse building videos and vanilla survival videos, with only a few featuring massive-content mods on the Fabric version.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm thinking, if the Replay mod could also support the Forge version after Minecraft 1.14, would it bring more creative space to content creators and give more confidence to the Minecraft creative community?

&amp;#x200B;

(Let's ignore invasions cuz those are still AoW bullet hell games and no patch will change that.) I am very interested to discuss and find out how we feel about the current duel meta.

Having seen them the most in the colosseum, has the greatsword class returned to the meta? Are they practically the fastest weapons with guaranteed poise break now? How does Knight's Greatsword compare to Baemore now?

How do we like curved greatswords now? Are the moves fast enough to compete with greatswords, or do we still need to rely on the wide sweeps to roll catch?

Collosals got a nice buff to scaling so it feels like a fair tradeoff between speed and damage, but are the moves versatile enough to be meta?

Are PSGS and halberds in a good place now? Do the hitboxes feel fair?

The problem was so significant that Niantic actually posted that they would do something to compensate the community... Instead of following through on that promise, they nerf remote raids instead?

Maybe they should fix the in-person experience before pushing the in-person experience",2,20,2023-03-31 08:34:09,2023,3

pokemongo,pierreo93,Discussion regarding remote raids,"Yes, another post of the remote raid changes, I know...

But I thought about an alternative and would love to know what the community would think of it.

If Niantic were to remove the different kind of raid passes from the game, and instead have just 1 raid pass that can be used both remotely and in person, depending on whether you're next to the raid or not, but people who do raid in person in-person get items as rewards (like they do currently), while remote raiders would only get the Pokemon encounter (and mega/primal energy when it applies), how would you feel?

&amp;#x200B;

This would mean everyone could do a raid daily, since the daily pass would also enable remote raiding, and would be able to get candy and hunt shinies, but it would still be a significant nerf to remote raids as you wouldn't get any revives or potions to heal the Pokemon you use in the raid, and also no golden razz/TMs/rare candy. 

I see a lot of people saying Niantic should increase rewards for in person raids in order to encourage people to go out, rather than punishing remote raiders, so this would seem like a balanced solution to keep in-person raiding more valuable, while also allowing people who can't/won't raid in person to still do raids.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I would be happy if Niantic made that change, keeping raid passes at 100 coins. Let me know what you think",2,0,2023-03-31 08:35:31,2023,3

Eldenring,RashAttack,Question about the merchants (spoilers),"Hey all,

Since Marika removed destined death from the elden ring, my understanding is that the way death works in the lands between is all messed up. People and creatures cannot die of natural deaths anymore, that's why you meet many zombie-like humanoids; they're just people who have aged for a ridiculously long time.

Following on from this logic, how come most of the merchants from the grand caravan burried under leyndell were dead or petrified? Sure there's a small handful that are still barely alive, but wouldn't the lack of destined death mean that they should all still be alive?",5,1,2023-03-31 08:43:32,2023,3

My coworker, a big soulike fan, told me that some bosses I had to do by myself because they are ""beautiful"", i don't know how to say it in English 😅. One of them is Maliket. I promised him to do it without summons, but after hours of trying I got angry and summoned the mimic and defeated it on first try.
I didn't keep my promise and now I don't feel satisfied.

Base game, Forsaken, Shadowkeep.  
Should i buy all the other expacs? What do i gain from buying the deluxe editions?  
I guess i cant play through the season quests as it all ends in a day or two.

I just want to try out raiding and really not be a bother. Can i still do raids without all the other expacs?

Is Ranni's quest ending in English canon called 'Age of the stars' or 'Age of stars'? Until the day of the publication of the paper guide of the game, I was sure it was the first option, since even the steam achievement in English reports Age of the stars and since ranni pronounces 'age of the stars' in the dialogue, but in the guide it is defined as Age of stars. Can anyone among you who is doing all these lucubrations and is much more cultured than me on the subject dispel my doubts?

With weapons and skills, so mighty and true, They explore the planets, in search of the new, They face their enemies, with bravery and might, Their destiny calls, to protect the light.

From Earth to the Moon, and beyond, They fight for their cause, with their bond, To defeat the darkness, that threatens to loom, Their courage and valor, shall seal their doom.

Their journey is long, their path is hard, But they stand united, with hearts unmarred, Their fate is sealed, in the battle's fray, Their destiny fulfilled, in the final day.

For they are the guardians, of Destiny 2, Their legend lives on, forever true, Their destiny calls, to fight the good fight, And in the end, they will shine so bright.",1,0,2023-02-27 10:33:26,2023,2

Eldenring,Shreekomandar_42,Unknown Great Runes,"According to Enia, there was only one other tarnished to bring together two great runes. Now, knowing this, there are three options for tarnished who could have achieved this:

One is Gideon, the only other Tarnished we see at this stage still trying to become Elden Lord. He seems to be a likely candidate, considering he is able to enter Leyndell after the Erdtree Burns. Another is Bernahl, whose armour set claims that he had also vied for Elden Lord until he lost his maiden to the ""flames."" Personally, I interpret these ""flames"" as being the frenzy flame, mostly because its the only ""flame"" that's actively being advertised as something that can burn the Erdtree down. 

The final option, and the one I think is most likely, is Vyke. Before our Player, Vyke was the closest person to becoming Elden Lord, before being seduced by the frenzied flame. This leads us to one, plainly obvious conclusion: Vyke had the great runes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question now becomes, who *were* these Demigods Vyke killed for his great runes? We know it cannot be any we meet, presumably, then, from a known faction. Of these, I think the Dragon cult, and the Godskins are the most likely. The Dragon Cult might have given Vyke their Rune willingly, maybe a gift from Lansseax herself. It would also explain why Vyke seemed to loyal to the Dragon Cult. We see his evergaol self not use incants from any other school. Something should have sparked this loyalty to the Dragons. 

The other cult I think, are the Godskins. They seem to be the only group to actively kill demigods/gods. It would fit into their lore if they killed the previous owner of a GR, and were killed in turn by Vyke/Bernahl (I say Bernahl, because there has to be a reason to why he helps you out with the Godskin Duo fight). 

There is, however, *two* Demigods with unconfirmed Great Runes. Ranni and Miquella. 

Ranni, you could argue, did not claim a Great Rune as hers, or maybe she just does not reveal it to the player. Whatever the case, Miquella seems to be the more interesting case. We know that Miquella was opportunistic enough to try and claim a shard of the Elden Ring as his own. Maybe his shard was supposed to help him bloom into a new god. Whatever the case may be, Miquella's rune is the only one completely unaccounted for. Maybe that's why Gideon was trying so hard to find Miquella: he wanted his GR.",6,0,2023-02-27 10:41:00,2023,2

DestinyTheGame,kjeldorans,Prediction: the last darkness subclass might be based on... Portals.,"*I know it is too early to give any reasonable guess but I wanted to try and leave it here... Time will tell.*

This guess is based on my previous post on the color of the third darkness subclass (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/wxi6dt/towerthought_the_last_darkness_subclass_color_is/ ) which is also... A wild guess but eh... Let's try it for fun.

So based on the observation made each darkness subclass unlocked by now has something to do with the main villain of the expansion... In fact:

• in beyond light we master stasis as way to beat stasis, Eramis main power.

• in the witch queen we should have used strand (see post above) and thus used... ""Mind powers"" (aka strand) against Savathun mind powers (throneworld).

Now we get lightfall which should have been the final expansion. Calus **can't** be the final enemy because it would not find into the ""conclusion of light and dark saga"" and thus we can guess that it is an afterthought, and only here to serve as ""campaign boss"". The real ""final boss"" is the witness... Of which we don't know much actually. However there always was a constant in cinematics featuring the witness: it controls minds and appears in reflections, mainly glass.

What I said alone doesn't say much but I have a couple more clues:

• ""appearing in glasses"" can be seen as ""being at the other end of a portal"". If you can create a portal and use any reflective surface as exit point that looks like a reflection to the other people watching it from outside... But it is in fact a portal.

• darkness powers have always something to do with ""environment manipulation"" and allows us to ""create something"" (stasis creates walls with *cosmic ice*, strand creates grapples/threadlings/etc. ... And the last one creates portals!). For the same reason Calus is not the final enemy, Neomuna isn't the final destination... The place where it was intended to end. The actuall final destination could be a ""strange place""... Where something unusual/unexpected happened/happens and which is covered in glass... Or in general reflective surfaces or maybe... In (reflective) *crystals*. 

The final point to the guess is the color (also guessed) of the final subclass: fuchsia. Not a big clue on this but fuchsia is a color often associated with ""mind games"" and we also have a representation of the same theme in another game: mesmer class in guild wars 2. The mesmer is a class based on mind games, illusions and portals... And the main color of the class is fuchsia.

For all the points made above my guess is that the last darkness subclass is letting us create portals as way to shoot bullets in one end and let those exit from the other end (pretty much *portal*, the game)... Or who knows, maybe we could even pass through them to reach harder places. This could create incredibly fun experiences in pve and surprisingly depressing deaths in the crucible. Nonetheless a fun mechanic.

Do you have any wild guess on the last darkness subclass?",13,0,2023-02-27 10:45:15,2023,2

World pool was limited to a somewhat small pool of very good guns. Funnelweb is an example. Lodbrok, Snorri, etc.


We lost Foundry Focusing with the transition from Witch Queen to Lightfall. Along with Umbrals being reworked/removed. 

Fine, great. I understand why they had to go. And personally, I love the new system because the new wallet system makes it sooo much easier to manage.


But god damn, Bungie populates the loot pool with these old weapons that do nothing but clutter up the pool. Alongside another thing that really grinds my gears.


The Seventh Seraph Carbine and Officer Revolver are in the Spire of the Watchers loot pool AND the World Loot pool.

Remove one of them, please. Preferably from Spire so I can stop getting Carbines and actually get an Long Arm roll that isn't mid AF.




TLDR: Please bring Foundry Focusing, remove the old World loot pool weapons (no origin trait = gone)",5,9,2023-03-30 06:54:29,2023,3

They swore I was boosting someone due to top fragging and they also claimed I was on an alt account. I don’t bring this up to flex, more so just ask why it’s so hard to just take a loss sometimes? The game ended in 13-2 and that just happens sometimes when playing in queues of that wide range in rank and when I explained that to them they just told me they’re reporting me.

It was working yesterday but now it won't and I have no clue as to why. I can still move items to/from my inventory with the shift key but only for one thing at a time and the key still works as normal but for some reason for this one thing it just refuses to work. I have quit the game and tried loading it back up, thinking it's just stuck or something, but it doesn't do anything. I am playing the Java version of the game on the latest version if  that matters at all.

RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,[Meta] Subreddit Rules,"Subreddit Rules
        
**I**. Your post MUST include [H] for ""Have"", and [W] for ""Want"". You must also include the platform you're planning to trade in. No Shitposts. Use /r/RLEMemes for memes.

Good title example:
[PC] [H] Pink Zomba Wheels [W] Offers

Bad title example:
Anyone want to trade for Frostbite??

You can also use [Discussion], [Meta], [Question], [Auction], [Price Check], and [Store] as tags.

Your item must be able to be traded at the moment of posting, no fake posts. You must own the item(s) and platform(s) you are posting (no posting for friends etc). Trades cannot be influenced on wording (cheap, quicksale, etc).
        
--------

**II**. You cannot offer or request money/non RL item exchanges on the subreddit OUTSIDE of the stickied [Anything-Goes thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/9vs8di/29_anything_goes_and_price_checking_threads/). (Paypal, gift cards, etc). You cannot make wager matches, blind trading posts/trading games, raffle posts, item begging posts, offer/request boosting/coaching services, or account sell/mod anywhere on this subreddit.
        
--------

**III**. Whether you are posting an item up for trade, or offering on a post by another user, you MUST keep all conversations out in the open to ensure all users are liable for their actions. No PM’ing or asking users to PM you to negotiate a deal outside of the ATG thread. Listing platform gamertags, IDs, friend codes, or references to negotiating elsewhere is not allowed.
        
--------

**IV**. You can only make one post every half hour to avoid spam abuse. Usage of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban of the alt and a 7 day minimum for the main account.

--------

**V**. Do not harass other users. Flaming (insulting users directly, name-calling, hate speech) may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from the subreddit at a moderator's discretion.
        
--------

**VI**. Do not hijack active trades (no trade sniping). If you want to request or offer an item, do it on your own thread or wait until the offer has been declined or completed. This includes giving unwanted advice/tips on another user's sale (no price policing).
        
--------

**VII**. Giveaways and blueprint revealing/trade-up streams (or videos) must be planned with moderators before being promoted. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7tc0wv/meta_a_rule_change_about_self_promotion/). Streams may only be promoted once per month by active users of the subreddit after moderator review.
        
--------

**VIII**. If you were scammed, report them through [ModMail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRocketLeagueExchange) with proof. Do not post about being scammed unless you've contacted ModMail for permission and that person has been added to the [Scam List](https://rltracker.pro/scam_list). Posting about someone scamming with no evidence or linking their scam list entry will result in a minimum 3 day ban. No witch hunting unless convicted scammer.
        
--------

**IX**. If you're having an auction, please read and follow the [auction rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/fingk8/meta_auction_formatting_rules/).

Tell everyone what you're trading up (rares, very rares, imports, exotics), and then tell everyone what you get! Even if it's not good (in your eyes), you may end up striking gold by getting the last piece of someone's coveted set! 

If you don't have a tradeup to do right now, feel free to share a recent tradeup you did over the past week instead to participate

RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,[Meta] Subreddit Rules,"Subreddit Rules
        
**I**. Your post MUST include [H] for ""Have"", and [W] for ""Want"". You must also include the platform you're planning to trade in. No Shitposts. Use /r/RLEMemes for memes.

Good title example:
[PC] [H] Pink Zomba Wheels [W] Offers

Bad title example:
Anyone want to trade for Frostbite??

You can also use [Discussion], [Meta], [Question], [Auction], [Price Check], and [Store] as tags.

Your item must be able to be traded at the moment of posting, no fake posts. You must own the item(s) and platform(s) you are posting (no posting for friends etc). Trades cannot be influenced on wording (cheap, quicksale, etc).
        
--------

**II**. You cannot offer or request money/non RL item exchanges on the subreddit OUTSIDE of the stickied [Anything-Goes thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/9vs8di/29_anything_goes_and_price_checking_threads/). (Paypal, gift cards, etc). You cannot make wager matches, blind trading posts/trading games, raffle posts, item begging posts, offer/request boosting/coaching services, or account sell/mod anywhere on this subreddit.
        
--------

**III**. Whether you are posting an item up for trade, or offering on a post by another user, you MUST keep all conversations out in the open to ensure all users are liable for their actions. No PM’ing or asking users to PM you to negotiate a deal outside of the ATG thread. Listing platform gamertags, IDs, friend codes, or references to negotiating elsewhere is not allowed.
        
--------

**IV**. You can only make one post every half hour to avoid spam abuse. Usage of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban of the alt and a 7 day minimum for the main account.

--------

**V**. Do not harass other users. Flaming (insulting users directly, name-calling, hate speech) may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from the subreddit at a moderator's discretion.
        
--------

**VI**. Do not hijack active trades (no trade sniping). If you want to request or offer an item, do it on your own thread or wait until the offer has been declined or completed. This includes giving unwanted advice/tips on another user's sale (no price policing).
        
--------

**VII**. Giveaways and blueprint revealing/trade-up streams (or videos) must be planned with moderators before being promoted. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7tc0wv/meta_a_rule_change_about_self_promotion/).

I understand the frustration around the mod system and the ridiculous cooldowns for Strand but all the hate over the story feels a little overblown. I alway viewed the story being good in D2 as icing on top of the excellent combat system but not something I worry too much about. I enjoyed most of the Lightfall missions from a gameplay perspective and I am excited for the raid. The tormentor sections were awesome , felt like I was running for my life every time I encountered them.

DestinyTheGame,Marshmallio,Why is the Quria mission not in the game?,"After playing the new strike, I am painfully confused as to why Expunge:Delphi isn’t in the game. The boss has infinitely more lore implications, has a very unique model, and the encounters preceding the boss room were generally more complex and enjoyable to execute. It’s the perfect length for a strike, and is a memorable moment in the Destiny franchise. If we had missions like these in the vanguard ops playlist instead of battlegrounds, each of which are individually forgettable and boring, player engagement with this core playlist. Don’t get me wrong, I like the new strike, but I have no clue what the justification is for removing Expunge:Delphi from the game when (9?) battleground activities are allowed to stay. New strike just strikes me as a Walmart version of the Quria mission, though that might be nostalgia factoring in.

Also another small thing, why is the chest model at the end of the new strike the standard vex one? They had unique vex network chests during season of the splicer.",5,0,2023-03-02 13:08:32,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,Bro_sapiens,"You guys remember Shadowkeep was a thing, right?","Is everyone forgetting Shadowkeep, an expansion that was priced at $40 standard and $60 Deluxe edition?

Like, I know everyone loved Witch Queen and I also thought it was a pretty good expansion compared to the previous one, but of course nowhere near as good as Forsaken.

But Shadowkeep was an absolute joke of an expansion, like talk about just a huge disappointment and nowhere near the value of what it was priced at when it came out. The campaign was super short, ended on a cliffhanger that we didn't get any follow up to for a long time.

It was marketed as this ""Dark, serious, scary"" expansion, but was it really anything like that? Sure it had some pretty decent atmosphere and neat moments, but it was really all gone before it even started. And of course there's the whole argument of the only new zone (the moon) being just a remake of an existing zone from Destiny 1.

And the story? We were supposed to finally get more info on Eris, her backstory, her fireteam, the OG moon fireteam, we barely got any of that, and if we did, you can bet your ass it was in form of a long lore tab entry, no fancy cutscene or anything like that!

Zavala going all ass on invading the moon with the Vanguard and taking it back from the hive literally an expansion later after rejecting the idea of avenging Cayde while even saying the line ""We are not an army..."" But then the moon is taken over by Hive (again)? F\*CK THAT, SEND EVERY GUARDIAN WE HAVE! Talk about bad writing.

I haven't bought Lightfall or played any Lightfall content yet, I've been more cautious about spending my money recently and work and other stuff got in the way as well. But is it really that much worse than Shadowkeep? And I'd understand the argument that after shadowkeep we had Beyond light and Witch queen which were both much better than Shadowkeep. But all this hate I'm seeing towards Lightfall and how Bungie needs to rethink their strategy and pricing and all that, just makes me think ""But... they've done worse things, they made Shadowkeep and priced it $40 for standard and $60 for deluxe, it was MUCH worse!""

I guess you could also argue that Shadowkeep was the expansion after Bungie cut their ties with Activision and the budget and workforce was expected to be significantly lower, which you can clearly see when we moved from Forsaken to Shadowkeep in the amount of content offered. And after the 3+ years since shadowkeep they'd learn how to make a proper expansion worthy of its price tag.

Maybe I'm overthinking this, but the truth is, Bungie releasing a bad expansion for Destiny 2 is nothing surprising or new to me. Should they rethink their strategy and do a much better job? Should we not accept this kind of quality going forward? Absolutely!

Just wanted to drop my 2 cents in, as someone who spent a whole lot of hours playing this game with his wife, someone who used to be very passionate about the franchise and the story as a whole, but lately has been taking it down a notch. All the criticism just made me remember how much faith I lost in Bungie the day Shadowkeep released.",8,0,2023-03-02 13:11:49,2023,3

I'm trying to learn to quickscope with a sniper and weapon swapping while sliding.

I don't quite understand what to do?

I have watched many youtube videos and read quite a bit. But I don't think they explain very well what i have to do.
Most recommend what attacments, parks and loadout to use. I have that under control.

Can anyone here explain to me how to do it, or have a good link that explains it?

I think I'm reasonably effective with a sniper, and malee. But I can't keep up with rank mahctes at all when there is someone who is good at using a sniper or switching to male weapons while they are sliding.",9,2,2023-03-02 13:19:03,2023,3

So the tweaks I'm thinking are- a damage buff (probably should wait for the fragment though) and maybe a change to their behavior- so they know if its necessary to have more of them target one enemy or if they should split off and target another enemy",8,8,2023-03-02 13:19:39,2023,3

Eldenring,Howmanybutts,"What is a ""Dream"" in Elden Ring / Fromsoft games?","I've been looking for more information on on this lore wise for a bit, but haven't been able to find much. What exactly is a ""Dream"" - such as Fia / Godwyn's Deathbed dream - because unlike the ""normal"" concept of a dream we have IRL, there seems to be a metaphysical reality to a Dream itself, like a pocket world in of themselves. 

Especially with DLC announcement people have been speculating it being set in the Dream of Miquella, and that somehow that is set in the land of the dead / in the past, it really has gotten me wondering more about it. 

We know too that dreams had a bigger role in the game at one point with the cut content and quest regarding ""dream brew"" - calling that the drink of the Demigods. So something seems up with it. 

And lastly, wasn't the last DLC for Darksouls 3 set within a dream (or a painting?...I didn't get to play it). So just wanted to know if anyone had more info or could point me towards more about it.",2,3,2023-03-02 13:22:21,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,Corrupt96,"Sword lovers, dont sleep on the re-rolled Bequest","TL:DR, Bequest with Vorpal beats other swords with Whirlwind blade up to 27 swings, after 28 Whirlwind does more, but obviously Vorpal requires no build up.

I know this is late, but since DSC weapons were re-rolled, Bequest can now get Vorpal weapon, and incase you dont know Bequest naturally hits harder than other swords of the same frame, this was to make up for its lackluster damage perks.

Anyway, for anyone interested in the maths :

Bequest + Vorpal = Normal Sword + Whirlwind Blade x8

so look at it this way, each swing with Bequest gets it 8 points, Whirlwind has a slow ramp, but eventually starts getting 10 per swing but it looks like this :

After : 

8 swings - 28x for whirlwind, 64x for bequest

11 swings - 55x, 88x

20 swings - 145x, 160x

28 swings - 225x, 224x

&amp;#x200B;

Its not often youre hitting something 28 times in a row, and with Vorpal have no proc requirements? best legendary sword if youre going for damage imo.

All that to say, unfortunately it doesnt have eager edge, so its obviously F tier lmao.",6,7,2023-03-08 15:39:40,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,Simplicitee123,"Bungie, please update the buffs UI","It has become even more painfully clear that Bungie **needs** to update the UI for displaying active effects like buffs, debuffs, etc. The current UI only has 4 slots to display these effects, and they get filled *wayyyyyyyyy* too quickly. Having any armor charge takes up one slot, surge mods take up another slot, subclass buffs take up more slots, Well and Bubble take up slots, and so on...

It's been getting out of hand for a while now, and even with the prioritization they have (for which buffs are actually displayed) there are just way too many effects that can be active at the same time for only 4 slots to be enough. I should be able to see *every* effect that is active, plenty of other games do this with even more effects.

DestinyTheGame,roli84,FYI for any AMD GPU guardians out there,"I updated to the latest AMD Adrenalin driver 23.3.1 and started having mico-stuttering issues. I finally got everything running smoothly again so thought I'd share what I did.

1. Updated my motherboard drivers. LAN, chipset etc (check your manufacturer's website)
2. Updated my bios version to the latest (check your manufacturer's website)
3. Enabled XMP (DOCP) which can be done through your BIOS
4. Not sure if this is needed but I also reset my shader cache. Steps are open AMD Adrenalin -&gt; 'Gaming' tab -&gt; Global Graphics -&gt; 'Advanced' -&gt; Reset Shader Cache. After resetting, your game might have some micro studder while the cache is rebuilt.

Now my game runs smooth again at a consistent 100+ FPS. Hope this helps my fellow guardians!

DestinyTheGame,therealwillietanner,Guardian Rank is not what you think it is,"Guardian rank is the future replacement for light level. That is why it's seasonal. Bungie has talked about getting rid of light level (a great idea), but they still want to time gate certain activities and/or ensure players have the skills to undertake them. Guardian rank is designed to make sure you run through a gauntlet before you unlock higher level activities. It's designed to replace the early season light level grind.  


Players want an actual ranking system, so Bungie should have two ranks: one seasonal and one career. The career rank should be built by assigning points to activity completions, with more points for more challenging ones. And each completion in a season should result in diminishing amounts of points to encourage a broad range of activities. Tally up all the points and assign a career rank from 1-100 based on your percentile rank in the player base. Or a simpler but not quite right method would be to start using Triumph score to do the same. Use Triumph score temporarily while you work on a better method.",13,0,2023-03-08 15:48:43,2023,3

I believe about a year or so ago I purchased all of the content up to and including beyond light and unfortunately again I put the game down for a while.

I am now back and very interested in sticking with the game and learning everything I can but when I loaded it up the other day I had absolutely no clue what I needed to be doing. So what I'm asking is with the content that I have what should be my first step and how should I go through the content I have? I plan to purchase the new dlcs after a while of getting back into the game but for now it's just the content up to beyond light.

DestinyTheGame,Piyaniist,Couple of Commendation change ideas,"-Make them completely optional. Aside from maybe some specific emblems, nothing big like ranks should require you to get or give someone commendations.

-Add more types of commendations that appeal to the playerbase (ex. 'Hard carry' 'Smartly Dressed' 'Lifesaver' 'Pathfinder' etc.)

Elaboration below, you can ignore if you wish.

On the first point: Making it mandatory for GR just results in people farming them and ends up as indicator of how much you played more than how much you actually got commended.


For the second point: The options given to commend should be stuff people actually would commend for after it isnt a must to level up your GR. Examples above were for, in order, 1) handling most of the mission and carrying their fireteam, 2) Having the best dripp in the fireteam. 3) Reviving or saving teammates be it invis or barriers etc. 4) Helping, showing the fireteam the mechanics for the raid etc.


Feel free to suggest more. I just think this is a good step but a wasted one to make it mandatory. Thanks for reading",0,1,2023-03-08 16:00:36,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,GehrmanHunter,Full Breakdown of all Ability related Armor-Mods,"# Hello again fellow Guardians!

*(\*Updated to include Heavy Handed and Firepower\*)*

One day ago i created a post providing you all with the actual Cooldown-Reduction percentages all the grenade related Armor-Mods provide. While i got the impression that it helped most of you, there were still unanswered questions and uncertainties regarding Proc.-CD and other ability mods. Seems as if i'm not the only one who wants to know what exactly a mod does so i can evaluate if it's a fit for a certain build.

So i sat down again and did some testing which ultimately lead to the results down below. This post includes the results from my last post, so you don't have to look it up.

(Disclaimer: my testing is not frame perfect, but i'm pretty confident in the results i got)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go:

&amp;#x200B;

# Head:

&amp;#x200B;

**HANDS-ON (HO)**

*""Gain bonus Super energy on melee kills.""*

* 0x HO: \~0,75% (each melee kill)
* 1x HO: \~2,5%
* 2x HO: \~2,9%
* 3x HO: \~2,9%

Note: A pain in the ass to test. Felt very inconsistent even after multiple tests.

&amp;#x200B;

**ASHES TO ASSETS (ATA)**

*""Gain bonus Super energy on grenade kills.""*

* 0x ATA: \~0,75% (each grenade kill)
* 1x ATA: \~4,8%
* 2x ATA: \~5,2%
* 3x ATA: \~4,8%

Note: Same as Hands-On.

Edit: Both mods tested on red-bars-enemies but scale off the tier of enemy defeated. (u/trunglefever)

(If anyone here wants to share some insight regarding those two mods i will gladly edit and include it in the post)

# Arms:

&amp;#x200B;

**GRENADE/MELEE- KICKSTART +Armor Charge**

""*When your grenade energy is fully expended, you gain grenade energy. Additionally, your Armor Charge is consumed and you gain additional grenade energy for each stack.""*

(As all the Kickstart-Mods work the EXACT same way, i'm going to use Grenade-Kickstart (GK) as an example)

Grenade-Kickstart (GK) refunds cooldown whenever your grenade energy is fully depleted. The way this whole system works is comparable to a ladder. The more steps, the more CD gets refunded. 1xGK is equal to one step on the ladder. 1xAC (Armor Charge) is equal to one step on the ladder. That means, that the CD refund of 1GK+4AC (5 ""steps"") is the same as 3GK+2AC (5 ""steps"")

* 1x GK + 0x AC: \~12,7% (refund)
* 1x GK + 1x AC: \~17,0%
* 1x GK + 2x AC: \~23,2%
* 1x GK + 3x AC: \~30,8%
* 1x GK + 4x AC: \~37,5%
* 1x GK + 5x AC: \~42,2%
* 1x GK + 6x AC: \~45,4%
* 2x GK + 6x AC: \~47,8%
* 3x GK + 6x AC: \~49,6%

Note:

Grenade-Kickstart will even proc with multiple grenade charges! So having 3GK equipped with 0AC means you get a total of \~46,4% energy refunded when throwing both grenades.

Melee-Kickstart WON'T proc with multiple charges.

Utility-Kickstart ""As best I can tell, while wearing Sixth Coyote, Utility Kickstart only works on one the first dodge when both charges are full and you would go down to the floor of the ""top"" charge"". If you dodge again before it's fully recharged, you don't seem to get the benefit?"" (- u/Squippit)

&amp;#x200B;

**MOMENTUM TRANSFER (MT)** (\~7sec cooldown)

*""Causing damage with a grenade reduces your melee cooldown.""*

* 1x MT: \~20%
* 2x MT: \~25%
* 3x MT: \~25%

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPACT INDUCTION (II)** (\~7sec cooldown)

*""Causing damage with a melee attack reduces your grenade cooldown.""*

* 1x II: \~20%
* 2x II: \~25%
* 3x II: \~25%

&amp;#x200B;

**FOCUSING STRIKE (FS)** (\~7sec cooldown)

*""Grants class ability energy when you cause damage with a melee attack.""*

* 1x FS: \~20%
* 2x FS: \~25%
* 3x FS: \~25%

&amp;#x200B;

**BOLSTERING DETONATION (BD)** (\~7sec cooldown)

*""Grants class ability energy when you cause damage with a grenade.""*

* 1x BD: \~20%
* 2x BD: \~25%
* 3x BD: \~25%

&amp;#x200B;

**HEAVY HANDED (HH)**

*""Your powered melee final blows create Orbs of Power.""*

* 1x HH: \~0,75% (Super refund per orb)
* 2x HH: \~1,05%
* 3x HH: \~1,2%

&amp;#x200B;

**FIREPOWER (F)**

*""Your grenade final blows create Orbs of Power.""*

* 1x F: \~0,75% (Super refund per orb)
* 2x F: \~1,05%
* 3x F: \~1,2%

Note: For Firepower and Heavy Handed the orbs were created by defeating red-bars. I don't know for certain if enemy tier matters here but i personally don't think it does.

* 3x IS: \~5,6%

Note: Yes, you read that right. Pretty shitty compared to its counterparts. (Tested on a Titan)

&amp;#x200B;

**ABSOLUTION (A)**

*""Reduces all ability cooldowns each time you pick up an Orb of Power.""*

* 1x A: \~5% (each ability)
* 2x A: \~7,5%
* 3x A: \~10%

Note: If you want your Class-Ability back chose this mod instead of Insulation.

&amp;#x200B;

* 1x OOR: \~10% (least recharged ability)

*""When your class ability energy is fully expended, you gain class ability energy. Additionally, your Armor Charge is consumed and you gain additional class ability energy for each stack.""*

(Like i said, all the Kickstart Mods work the same)

* 1x UK + 0x AC: \~12,7%
* 1x UK + 1x AC: \~17,0%
* 1x UK + 2x AC: \~23,2%
* 1x UK + 3x AC: \~30,8%

**DESTRIBUTION (D)**

*""Reduces all ability cooldowns when using your class ability near targets.""*

* 1x D: \~4%
* 2x D: \~7%
* 3x D: \~7%

Note: Using it near only one enemy or a whole group of enemies sadly makes no difference.

&amp;#x200B;

**ONE-TWO FINISHER (OTF) +Armor Charge (AC)**

*""Finishers restore melee abilities. Consumes 3 or more stacks of Armor Charge, granting additional energy for each charge consumed.""*

* OTF + 3x AC: \~70%

Minecraft,Into_The_Storm,Does anyone know about breeding tarantula hawks?,"Been working on building a tarantula hawk farm to get their wings for an Eleytra upgrade. Figured I can make an area next to a spider spawner, feed them fermented spider eyes, and they attack the spiders until a larva comes out of the spider.

However, this seems to work only once as I tried to get the same tarantula hawks to breed, they straight up kill the spiders instead. I made the enclosure for the TH big enough and put sand in so they can bury the infected spiders but other than that I don’t know what I did wrong.

Does anyone have suggestions on a better way to breed tarantula hawks? And I’ve read that a TH could have a “baby banner”; is there a way to identify a pregnant TH?

The tarantula hawks are from Alex’s Mobs mod in case anyone is curious. Thanks!",3,0,2023-03-08 16:06:44,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,gabriel_is,Commendations Feedback,"Currently commendations are frankly a completely wasted system, here is why

1. we are incentivized to spam them
2. in many cases the variety of commendations we can give do not correlate to meaningful descriptions
3. the way you give them seems to have been built with no knowledge of how players actually play the game, in pvp for example, the game ends, you have 5 seconds of running around unable to see half the screen, 3 seconds of staring at an unmoving character, 2 seconds of waiting for the post game screen to load, then you can give commendations, if you havent left, and they havent left, this is absurd

Here is what is needed for this system to mean something

1. there should be no incentive to spam commendations (if I need 6000, and need to give dozens away for rewards, it is against my own interest to be thoughtful in giving them out)
2. they must describe something we could have observed in the game (in mm there are no comms, so how can I know who was fun?)
3. it must be possible to give commendations outside of the activity and regardless of who is still in it
4. there should be more descriptors that I can give than commendations I can send (ie in strikes I could have clutch, fast, supportive, dps, and fashionable that I can give, but I can only give 2)
5. it must be possible to give commendations while viewing stats
6. post activity stats need to include more information so I can use them to decide who gets what
7. post activity screen should make it easy to tell who played which subclass, bare min should show what they have equipped, bc I may know that the arc titan is who I want to commend, but figuring out who that was in time to give out a commendation is not possible

In the current system players have left the activity faster than there is often even time to give them out before the next activity begins, there is usually approx 10-30 seconds of downtime after an activity and players know this so they arent just sitting there wasting time waiting for a menu to load. There is no conceivable benefit to disallowing me to say that the best player was the best player just bc they didnt want to sit in a raft of loading screens  


Look if the goal was to make numbers go up, and frustrate people who want to engage with commendations, and get people to find some exploit to max commendations and avoid the entire system while still being rewarded, congrats you nailed it, if you wanted this to be a way for people to say x player is good at y thing, then frankly you failed super duper hard. There are almost defintely technical issues with some of this, and frankly that is a you problem, if you cant make a good system bc of technical constraints a meaningless system is not a happy medium it is just a waste of everyones time.  


This is a face plant just like loadouts not pulling items from other characters, and not saving artifact settings, clearly it was made without considering how people actually play the game",19,24,2023-03-08 16:08:51,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,TheBitwolf,For Titans: A Ranged roaming super idea for Strand. Feel free to leave a name for it in the comments.,"I'll preface this by saying, I think this pity party is of unprecedented levels, but I feel things could have been done differently. No I won't iterate on the flame thrower idea since flames is for solar, and this is an element of its own.

—————

Now I haven't named this idea, but it's a concept for a ranged roaming super for that works in two stages like Shadebinder, but different, what the Titan would do is throw something like a projectile, dart or needle, it'd require aim, once it has connected, the Titan would clap, grip his hands together, taking a hold of strings of strand and pull, enemies that have the new suspend (hanging in the air debuff) would take monster damage. 

It would require aim for both moves, the first attack dealing minor damage, the other one dealing the blunt of the damage. It could also have a melee where Titans just grapple to that enemy, do the special grapple melee, pushing the enemy away and if this move kills the enemy, it will make like a void hunter's teather that in PVE will suspend nearby enemies, but in PVP will only just attach to guardians, and when they do the ""pull"" to that anchor point, all connected enemies would take damage and all connected guardians that aren't on their supers would go bye bye.

This is just a concept, I'm not trying to be an armchair dev and telling you guys what to do or scoff at what you did do, just… a creative thought, thinking different because yea, Titans actually, really, truly, honestly, properly need a ranges super instead of more melee supers. 

Sincerely.

Genshin_Impact,Isaak1024,Making Dehya a Tank,"Mihoyo wants to make Dehya a tank but her current kit doesn´t reflect that. At the same time the community expected her to be a burgeon user or a pyro Yelan. I'm trying to change her kit so she can function as a burgeon/overload tank, while keeping all her animations, because those ar lit!

For me a tank is someone who can take a lot of damage, but is dependent on his team for heals and damage. The kit is designed to restrict the usage of shield in favor of heals. The main damage should happen through burgon/overload, which symbolises the dependency on other damage sources. Finally i added a fury/rage mechanic because i thought it would fit her style

Normals: atk based

Skill: when aktivated deals aoe pyro damage based on \[\]% of dehyas max Hp and creates a field.

	field: Character in the field gain interruption and pyro damage resistence.

	Dehya gains the ability flame mane fury. When Dehya recives damage she gains one stack of  flame mane fury.

	fmf 1: infuses Dehya´s wapon with pyro

	fmf 2: every time Dehya takes damage increases her max Hp by \[\]%

	fmf 3: converts \[\]% of Dehyas max Hp into atk

Burst:  the 11 hits count as nomal attacks with pyro application on hit 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. Scales of atk

Passiv 1: when on field shares \[\]% of  recived healing with all teammates. When off field shares taken damage.

When I get 2 team mates that know what to do and have good builds, its a lot of fun. But carrying 2 makes the mission feel like a slog.

I had a blast playing through the game, needed to use a walkthrough at times for direction, and I am now going back and getting all the shit I missed LOL.  


I want to play through NG+ but I want to farm runes in Mogwyn as early as possible.  I have read that you get 2x runes in NG+ so I would rather finish everything I need to get and then jump right in.  


My question is, can you complete Varre's questline to unlock Mogwyn while skipping Godrick?   I have read that you have to beat Godrick, but Ive also read you can skip it and rest in Liurnia.  I did that on my first playthrough and I seem to remember that the door to Enia's room was locked until after I had defeated Godrick.  And it seems like speaking to Enia is what triggers Varre to move to Rose Church.  Can any of you vets help me out?  I dont want to screw it up but I would also rather farm before starting my playthrough.  


And if so, does that have ANY effect on other NPCs?  I want my second playthrough to include a lot of the NPCs as I missed a bunch of them playing blind.  That's why I would prefer to just make a clean run to complete Varre's questline, then farm, then start the playthrough and use a guide to make sure I don't screw up all the NPCs.  Like I missed so much.

DestinyTheGame,LegoWitch,Neomuna patrol enemies take ~30% more damage to kill than Master Raid enemies,"TL;DR tweet with GRAPH: [https://twitter.com/mossy\_max/status/1639077134940471300](https://twitter.com/mossy_max/status/1639077134940471300) 

MossyMax, the [Outgoing Damage Scaling Guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/umnoex/exhaustive_breakdown_of_every_outgoing_damage/) here again.

Since Master Vault of Glass is available this week, I had an opportunity to test the new changes to master raids. I tested both the way outgoing damage scales, as well as how the enemy HP scales, using [the method I outlined in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/w8jbxz/i_figured_out_a_way_to_measure_any_enemys_hp/).

# Master Raid = Contest Raid (mostly)

As promised, Bungie changed the enemy HP scaling from similar to Master NFs down to the same as regular raids. The previous HP scaling was about 50% higher, depending on the enemy, before accounting for Power Level differences. In addition, they changed the outgoing scaling formula to be the same as regular raid. This only gives you \~7% more damage vs. before, but it's better than nothing.

All this to say, ***if you don't use overcharge/surge for the 25% buff***, Master raid is now identical to contest raid in terms of how quickly you kill and get killed by enemies, maxing at a 0.54x outgoing damage multiplier. Obviously there's more champions and shields to manage, but with the siphon and bricks from beyond artifact perks, that could be a positive. If you do use the 25% surge/overcharge buff (0.68x multiplier total), you deal damage equivalent to about a -10 contest mode, rather than -20. You still die just as fast, which is arguably the bigger challenge in this context.

# Neomuna is TANKY

So, onto my clickbaity title. Early in the season I checked how damage scales in Neomuna, and found that on patrol and in lost sectors you have a -15 delta, using the same difficulty curve as raids, giving you a 0.61x multiplier to damage. For comparison, all other patrol spaces (and campaign missions) use the normal difficulty curve and have a +50 delta cap, for a 1.4x maximum multiplier, over 2 times the damage.

At the time, I thought this was balanced out by having the enemies using the same HP scaling as other planets, but NO. I just tested, and the scaling is even higher than in the raid. I haven't tested every enemy HP tier, but here's an example with a minor (red-bar) goblin:

|Activity Type|Goblin HP|
|:-|:-|
|Patrol|175|
|Regular and Master Raid, Gambit|220|
|**Neomuna Patrol**|**250**|
|Dungeon|350|
|Old Master Raid|375|

As a sanity check, I just tested bullets to kill a goblin with Rufus's Fury, a weapon with low enough damage to see differences (and also would get the 25% strand surge in Master VoG):

|Activity|Number of Rufus bodyshots to kill a goblin|
|:-|:-|
|Regular VoG (+20 raid)|13|
|Master VoG (-20 with 25% strand surge)|21|
|Neomuna patrol|28|

As you can see, for goblins, you need 30% more bullets to kill in Neomuna than in master VoG. In practice of course, you face a lot more champs and minibosses in a raid encounter than on neomuna, so it's not like it's a cake-walk, but per-enemy-killed, Master Raid is in fact easier. This also doesn't account for differences in incoming damage, which I'm not the expert on testing. But just anecdotally, you die WAY quicker in master raids than on Neomuna.

# I Don't Actually Hate it?

What do you guys think of this change? On paper it sounds ridiculous, but I haven't hated the experience of neomuna patrol, besides the threshers. It's nice to have a higher skill floor to keep you sharp, so you don't have to drastically readjust your tactics every time you enter challenging content.",729,4984,2023-03-24 15:03:46,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,lipp79,Titan's need a burst damage distance super,"I'm talking about a burst super that you can use from inside a Well of Radiance for example, and immediately go back to damage without having to run back to the Well after a Thundercrash. Warlocks have Nova Bomb and Needlestorm. Hunters have Golden Gun (using Celestial Nighthawk), Blade Barrage, Gathering Storm, Moebius Quiver, Silence and Squall.

Titans have zero of these types of supers except for the aforementioned Thundercrash, but again that is one that in a lot of cases, makes you leave the group as you fly to to damage, and in some cases, it's useless because you can only damage certain bosses from the spot everyone is standing in, like the planets encounter in RoN. We just have a ton of roaming super which are useless for boss damage. It's either TC or ""Where do you want the bubble?"". Sure you can throw your hammers or do Burning Maul but you'll incur the wrath of your team if you're using those over Thunderlord, LFR with firing line, Gally strat, etc. I just think we Punchy McPunchersons need a distance burst damage super.

DestinyTheGame,Corrupt96,"Would love to see Mobility get a PvE ""Evasion"" mechanic.","Its no secret that mobility is considered absolute trash in PvE outside of reducing Hunters dodge cooldowns. As it stands : 

Resilience : 30% PvE Resist, 10% Flinch Resist, 8% Max Health increase.

Mobility : Walk 40% faster.

So give it a % chance to completely nullify all damage when you take a direct non-explosive hit in PvE only. I think 20% sounds like a reasonable number for T10. Still wouldnt be as good as resilience with its consistent damage resist, but it would be a massive help.

Hey guys! I put out a poll yesterday and it received a majority of votes for the initiator class! This poll is for which specific agent you'd like me to 1-trick, master, and make videos on! All of my progress with the agent will be shared publicly and I'm going to try to use this as a resource for players learning how to play the agent! The only initiator I have much experience with is Breach, so for any other one, I'd basically be starting from scratch. Thanks for the help!

Edit: Meant to make the poll last 1 day but forgot to change it from the default 3 LOL. I'll be picking my agent based off of whatever has the most votes at this time tmrw

Edit 2: You can check out the resources and videos that I'll be making from this journey to mastery with the links in my profile! There will be a macro course, micro course, and youtube series dedicated to this. All FREE of charge. I just want to show people an example of how to learn an agent and what that path looked like for me!

DestinyTheGame,Boarf2,Are people really having fun on this new difficult?,"So I was doing some nightfall runs today o hero difficult and my fucking god. I was using the void build with my warlock, and I had a terrible time doing this. 
I am a old player with 4k+ hours in D1 and 2.7k in D2, and i can't remember a time where I had less fun in this game. Even in D2 vanilla with the abilities taking forever to charge. I liked to turn off my brain and run strikes or do some lost sectors when I needed to relax, and now... Well the only place to do that are public events anywhere but neomuna. And what's is the point of doing that? To get 3 legendary shards from maybe the legendary you will get at the end? 
So my question is, is it really more fun now for some of you? I want to know if the problem is with me and maybe the game is not for me anymore or are the majority of people hating this?

Edit: spelling
Edit 2: just to throw some info at y'all, I am ATM at 1824  with my warlock who right now is my main, I like to change my build once in a while, but usually I am the Well Guy with starfire, or i use the void one with the vortex granade and the exotic gloves i can't remember the name, or use the brood weaver with the boots or the poison gloves. In all of then I have 100 resilience, 100 discipline and in most of then 80 recovery, only in the void one I have 50 recovery. 

and yeah, the go to relax activities right now are raids and dungeons lol",955,920,2023-03-24 15:27:02,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,dumppity,Why does competitive have a max rating?? (Relatively long but insightful read),"In almost every single other game which has a competitive PvP mode, the **the amount of rating you get lowers as you get higher ranks.** This makes those games’ ranked game modes much more competitive as the best players are there to win to slowly reach rank 1. 

Competitive in destiny caps at 10000 rating in the ascendant rank. While it might be hard and even with decay, once a person reaches max rank, that would be it for them. **This alienates the best destiny PvP players from playing competitive.**

An example I would use to show how this  can is a bad model is to compare to worlds first races. **It would be as if worlds first races only had day 1 completions and no title for the first completion.**

Destiny is in a unique position in that it has **SUCH A HUGE OPPORTUNITY** to grow its competitive PvP player base right in front of its face. 

All it needs to do is just to tweak the competitive framework that it has and this would attract the **already huge PvP player base of destiny** who can really only use trials as an outlet to play high stakes PvP. The main change that needs to happen is that the max rating is removed and rating increase is slowed as a player enters higher ranks.

Another tiny tweak I **really** want to see is leaderboards for destiny such as in overwatch and WOW. The benefit of Leaderboards is that they give the players of those games clear goals to beat and they put your name out there as the best of the best. 

**Competitive players are loyal to a game and this is very important for a game’s survival.** Fostering these types of players helps games like CSGO, LOL, and WOW to stay relevant for long periods of time.

I know bungie is scared of touching competitive since what happened in 2017. However, I also know that destiny has evolved since then. Take worlds first races for example. They are fun because they are competitive and everyone is reaching for the title of first completion. Destiny now has the potential to generate an absolutely massive competitive player base and bungie doesn’t even need to spend a crazy amount of resources to do it. 

so I ask bungie to devote some development time to help competitive flourish and be the mode it was always meant to be.

**TLDR**: bungie needs to remove the max rating on competitive and make it so that rating gained is lowered the higher a person’s rank is. Bungie should (notice that I said should and not that they need to) add leaderboards. Destiny has the potential to grow a massive competitive player base.

Genshin_Impact,-sevkatu-,Things I really like about Genshin as a very casual player,"Let's preface this post by saying that I am a ***disgustingly*** filthy casual. I like to take my time with games. What bring me joy is frolicking around every nook and cranny for 5 mora of gratification without actually caring whether I do get everything or not, while competitive games stress me the hell out and back. I am the person who will talk to every single NPC they find, regardless of whether it is an important character or those two kids on the outskirts of Inazuma city near the tomato garden or Watatsumi island guards and shrine maidens. Yes, I am probably one of the five poeple who actually quite enjoyed learning about the NPCs during the first Lantern rite, although I admit meeting playable characters is still better.

Moreover, as an avid MMORPG player in the past, I've come to appreciate a lot of the things about Genshin Impact that maybe some people don't find as important. So, this post is mostly a culmination of my thoughts about this game after almost three years of playing since launch.

**You are free to agree or disagree**, having an opinion is not a crime. What I enjoy and think is reasonable is by far not a universal truth, I just really like this game.

Let's start then!

**1. This game is really free to player friendly**

For me personally, this is a big one. If you ever had the pleasure of playing a ""F2P"" asian MMORPG, you quickly realise that being ***free*** is relative. So colour me suprised when I realised that pretty much none of the actually important content or additional stuff was behind a paywall. I see a lot of criticism that you *have* to spend in Genshin but I strongly disagree. Sure, you probably won't be able to get a C6 of every limited character, or every single limited character overall, without paying. But do you even  really *need* all of the limited characters? Playing the game for 1 - 2 hours a day with maybe longer sessions on weekends during big updates, even with terrible luck of losing pretty much every single 50/50 and getting a character outside soft pity like three times I still gathered a pretty nice pool of characters I enjoy. And let's be real, building characters is a pain in the arse, so even if you get the character, you still need to build them to actually use them. Additionally, as someone who builds every single character they have... I am glad I don't have all of them lol.

While some may not agree, I don't think the rates are as atrocious. Sure, maybe some games do have better ones, but the existence of soft pity does make it pretty easy to calculate your wishes accordingly. And for me, I'll take not having every character if that means getting rest of the content and additional stuff for free.

**2.  There is not that much to do in the endgame**

Put down the pitchforks please, let me elaborate. I am a university student in a pretty time consuming major, which means I don't have as much free time already. Moreover, I have other hobbies and responsibilities, like touching grass. I know, disgusting. As such, I am unable and also unwilling to spend half my day grinding materials or improving my skills, which is the reason I am a *past* MMORPG player. Which is where Genshin comes to perfectly satisfy my casual gaming needs. Since there is literally not that much you can do usually, I can hop on and off in about an hour, scratching my itch for playing, and go about my day, without stressing out about keeping up with other players or missing out on stuff. And before you ask yes, my resin is regularly capped to 160 thank you very much. And no, I do not care the slightest. I also pretty much never touch Abyss, even though I can pretty comfortably complete the Abyss up until the 11th floor. I have also never completed the 12th floor of the Abyss. Admittedly, I haven't really tried, ever. I value my mental health more.

All in all, I think the content update rate is really good, not too fast but not to slow either, meaning most of the substantial updates are pretty high quality, with maybe some less impressive but still amusing smaller events inbetween. And it is especially nice to see Mihoyo investing more into the game, with the newer areas, character interactions and stories being so much more elaborate, you can see the passion of the developers behind all the minute details.

While I think adding something else to do for the more passionate endgame players is a good idea, I really do wonder if most of the ideas I see people presenting like a boss rush or a neverending mode won't get stale after a while. Because Genshin Impact, while it can get quite complicated in its mechanics, at it's base is a very simple game. And I think the reason for that is that it was never meant to be a game you spend a long session on everyday. There are a plethora of much more suitable games for that, which actually reward such a mindset. And Genshin is not one of them.

**3. Genshin Impact is at it's core a personal adventure**

I touched upon this point before, but the uncompetitive nature of the core aspect of Genshin is what I really love about this game. Most games that feature interaction between players are build upon a confrontational nature of competing with each other, like Valorant, Apex, League, Heartstone and so on. A lot of them are also team based games, which... I know I am a shit player, I don't need to be constantly reminded of that. Furthermore, I neither wish to be a burden for the team or be beaten over and over again by much more passionate players, who put their heart, sweat and tears into mastering these games. There is nothing wrong with that if that's what brings you joy, but I'd literally rather spend 20 minutes watching elaborate sand footprints than spend 20 minutes being destroyed in a match.

My only big gripe here is that the overall co-op experience is pretty underwhelming. While I still love going into my friend's worlds and helping them out with exploring my favourite areas (I've explored Dragonspine like 5 times by now, I know it like the back of my hand), I would like to be able to actually *do something* more than just be emotional and combat support.

**4. I think a lot of the points I mentioned are the reason for why Genshin became so popular**

As a conclusion to my points previously, I think the fact that Genshin is very much casually oriented, with simple mechanics and easy to pick up gameplay, while also not being extremely time consuming but still having regular updates, is what led to it's massive popularity amongst a wide variety of players (amongst of course a whole range of other reasons like great graphics, not being that taxing on the hardware, interesting characters and story, lore and so on). Because I see a lot of, let's say, non-gamers really enjoying Genshin, without being really into games overall. As such, it has also become a perfect game to introduce my non-gamer friends into gaming, which allows me to share my passion for games as a medium to them as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are your thoughts? I am sure I haven't even scratched the tip of the iceberg. Genshin Impact is by far not a perfect game, and it has a lot of flaws (cough RNG system cough), but it did become a really dear part of my life in the last years.

DestinyTheGame,ChappieHeart,Why is any criticism towards the game downvoted here?,"Title.   


Just because you don't worship the game, doesn't mean you hate it. Hell, if I waste my time criticising the game it clearly means I care about it. I don't understand why this subreddit is so toxic towards anyone who isn't worshipping the ground Bungie stands on, Destiny really is getting less and less 'Destiny' and it's sad to see a lack of people really talk about it out side of fringe groups like NovemberHotel.   


And before anyone says 'Don't play 4head', let it be known that that is the kind of criticism that literally helps nobody, it doesn't go further for any kind of discussion and actually kills any attempt of discussion or understanding of another's opinion.  


So why are unfavourable opinions of Destiny so hated on here? Or is it just a Reddit thing that everywhere on this site is a circle jerk?",66,0,2023-02-07 12:29:12,2023,2

DestinyTheGame,TehSavior,I think the game needs a vault rework.,"Getting extra space every once in a while is nice and all, but playing multiple characters eats it up fast.

So why not split things?

Give the vault a separate storage tab for armor for each class. 

Right now the cap is 600 for all characters.

I'm not suggesting space be taken away, but rather, a second panel be added to the vault for class specific storage. Let's say in addition to the current vault setup, each class gets its own little 200 slot box that only armor can be put in.

Would solve a lot of headache, i think. I'm always struggling with vault space, and having to get rid of weapons for the sake of builds always felt bleh.",10,0,2023-02-07 12:35:48,2023,2

VALORANT,Tinynoxx,Valorant should have an honor system like League,"So hear me out, everyone is sick of trolls and toxic people in their games. If we had a system where we can commend people and report unsavory behaviour that affects honor progressions like league, less people would have their games ruined.

The honor system like league would reset every act and if someone falls under a certain point, they get punishments like voice/chat restriction until they gain honor, temp bans, etc. etc. If not too complicated, it'd be AMAZING if they could make it so that people with less honor are more likely to match up with each other, so trolls will all be in games together instead of queueing up with players that want to have a good time.



EDIT: for the people worried that toxic players would report them and lower their honor, I meant that penalties would be applied to easily provable things like text abuse, afks(not dcs) and perhaps team damage if it reaches a certain number and causes multiple party kills. Not like a dislike button on youtube. 

Also I know this idea has holes in it but it's just an idea! One that devs could test and polish to minimise abuse. I find the discussion fun, and would love it if Val discourage bad behavior more as well as reward people who are genuinely lovely.",59,337,2023-02-07 12:53:53,2023,2

RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,[Meta] Scamming Methods &amp; How to Avoid,"#[](https://imgur.com/a/TLlZl0a)CHECK THE [SCAM LIST](https://rltracker.pro/scam_list) FIRST!

**Message [ModMail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRocketLeagueExchange) if you encounter any scams! Be sure to record/screenshot any scam attempt as this is needed for scam list.**

* **

#Youtube Thumbnail / Flexing items

Summary:

* Scammer will ask you to put some cool items in a trade and ready up in the final trade window when they do for a YouTube thumbnail (some may offer credits/items for helping) or flex items for a screenshot by telling you to cancel trade after readying up. 

How to Avoid:

*  Do not ready up / accept a trade offer unless you are fine with the outcome.

* **

#Item Swapping

Summary:

* Scammer will put a valuable item (such as TW Octane) in the trade window with a bunch of junk items (over 8 items so it doesn't show color/cert). Once you make your offer, the scammer will ask you to add more items (or some sort of question) to make you click the open chat screen to hide the trade window. While you're distracted, scammer quickly swaps that item to a different color (such as grey octane or nothing to hide it) and ready's up in trade hoping you don't notice. This works the same way with certifications and items both painted &amp; certified. The scammer would put a striker tw octane with a bunch of junk and swap to a regular tw octane. This is hard for scammers to pull off with the new trade accept screen but please be wary as some may still attempt.

How to Avoid:

* Do not accept a trade unless you verify the trade is everything you want. If a scammer changes the trade offer, you will have to ready up again and accept the trade so please verify the trade is what you want. Scammers commonly remove credits in hope you don't see them in the final accept screen so watch out for that!

* **

#Item Begging/Trust

Summary:

* Scammer will ask you to try on items you have or request items for a YouTube video etc. and claim to give them back or want them for trust and promise to give them back with reward etc.

How to Avoid:

* Don't give anyone items and expect them to give it back. all trades are final.

* **

#Phishing Rewards/Tournaments/Other

Summary:

* Scammer will send you a link to get stream fan rewards, participate in a tournament for rewards, or make your trade requests by logging into a website.

How to Avoid:

* [Enable 2 step verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/aggtz2/discussion_mods_can_we_please_get_a_sticky_about/). If your account is compromised by falling victim to these sites, 2 step will slow them down. Never log into a website for fan rewards unless it's https://rewards.rocketleague.com/ and verify other trading/tournament sites by looking it up via google. If you decide to sign in anywhere, make sure you are on your platforms website (live.com sony.com steamcommunity.com nintendo.com) and check if the sites [SSL connection is secure](https://www.hubspot.com/ssl-checker). If you fall victim to these sites, go [here](https://support.rocketleague.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015695333-What-If-My-Account-Has-Been-Compromised-).

* **

#DLC Car Pack Codes

Summary:

* Scammer will claim to have DLC codes for premium rocket league packs (like the GTR Skyline) which were discontinued back with the blueprint update.

How to Avoid:

* 99.99% of these trades are scams. The only possible way for someone to legitimately have a code is if they used the gift feature on xbox back when they were available, and did not redeem the code of-course (these codes can only be redeemed on the xbox marketplace). DLC packs were discontinued unannounced so the odds of someone actually owning them is extremely low, but is still possible so always use a trusted middleman. If you're wanting a old DLC car, you'll have to wait for Psyonix to give us more information for *if* they'll return via item shop.

* **

#Fake Middleman

Summary: 

* Scammer has a friend using an account to impersonate an official middleman or reputable trader by having a similar name (ie. 'A**L**um' shows as 'Alum' while A**i**um shows as 'AIum') 

How to Avoid:

*  Use the [Official Middleman List](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/ju4ivv/official_trusted_middleman_thread/) (located in sidebar or about tab) or reputation thread to verify who you are talking to. Put a number in chat and message the middleman on reddit to verify.

* **

#DDoS

Summary:

* Scammer will get your IP address to then threaten you with your location to hack or shutdown your internet unless you give them free items.

How to Avoid:

* Do not join party chats on xbox/psn of people you don't know or click on links you do not trust as it could be an IP logger. Rocket league is all server sided (not Peer2Peer) so no one can get your IP address in-game or in a lobby. You cannot be hacked from someone knowing your IP, location is not 100% accurate (to the public at least) but they can flood your internet and have it go down. If you ever get hit offline, unplug your modem and/or router for 5 minutes and see if your internet is back. If you still do not have internet, you will need to request an IP change from your ISP (internet service provider).

* **

#Fake Reputation

Summary:

* Scammer will create a reddit account similar to another traders reddit who has reputation to make the victim go first without using a middleman. 

How to Avoid:

* Double &amp; triple check the user who you are messaging is the owner of the linked rep thread. Make sure you are still on reddit.com and our subreddit when viewing rep. Make sure the reddit account does not have low karma/activity. If you have concerns about a user, feel free to contact the moderators.

#PayPal Invoice/Chargeback

Summary:

* Scammer will send you a money request on PayPal with a note making it look like they sent you a payment and ask for the items to be traded. In rare cases, the scammer may actually send you the money but open a dispute as unauthorized charge (any payment can be disputed, even as friends &amp; family).

How to Avoid:

* Do not accept the payment as you will be sending them money. Invoices will popup as requests. If a payment is sent, it will go straight into your balance (unless PayPal is directly holding the money for varies reasons which they will tell you it's on hold). Recommend selling to reputable sellers and avoid new reddit account or accounts with little to no activity. If you take a risk with someone new, always research their platform id to make sure it's not an alt account.

#The Duplication Glitch

Summary:

* Scammer will claim they can duplicate your items if you give it to them.

How to Avoid:

* There is no duplication glitch.

* **

#Over 24 Items

Summary:

* Scammer will want to trade you 24+ items for your item and ask you to go first. Once you do the first trade, they leave.

How to Avoid:

* Use an [Official Middleman](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/ju4ivv/official_trusted_middleman_thread/) (located in sidebar or about tab) to help with the trade.

* **

#Fake Overpay

Summary: 

* Scammer will claim someone is offering more for an item they have to make you raise your offer or use multiple accounts to trick you into making that trade.

How to Avoid:

* Don't pay more than what you are willing to spend on an item. Make a [PriceCheck] post if you would like to hear from other traders on the value and/or situation.

* **

#Fake Trade Offer

Summary: 

* Scammer will claim their item(s) are in the trade window and send you a fake screenshot (or stream with fake overlay) showing a different trade that what is on your screen.

How to Avoid:

* The trade window will always show the correct item(s). If you believe it's bugged like they claim, use an  [Official Middleman](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/ju4ivv/official_trusted_middleman_thread/) (located in sidebar or about tab) or cancel the trade entirely. Only accept a trade if you are fine with the outcome.

* **

#Certification Glitch

Summary:

* Scammer will claim their item has a certification that is not showing in the trade window. Some cases, the scammer will send you a fake screenshot (or stream with fake overlay) showing the certification.

How to Avoid:

* Do not trust this. As of 10/26/20, Psyonix has fixed certifications not showing up (used to be an issues few years ago). If this becomes a bug in the future or you start to believe it, use an [Official Middleman](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/ju4ivv/official_trusted_middleman_thread/) (located in sidebar or about tab) to verify the item is in fact certified. Only accept a trade if you are fine with the outcome.

RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,[Meta] Subreddit Rules,"Subreddit Rules
        
**I**. Your post MUST include [H] for ""Have"", and [W] for ""Want"". You must also include the platform you're planning to trade in. No Shitposts. Use /r/RLEMemes for memes.

Good title example:
[PC] [H] Pink Zomba Wheels [W] Offers

Bad title example:
Anyone want to trade for Frostbite??

You can also use [Discussion], [Meta], [Question], [Auction], [Price Check], and [Store] as tags.

Your item must be able to be traded at the moment of posting, no fake posts. You must own the item(s) and platform(s) you are posting (no posting for friends etc). Trades cannot be influenced on wording (cheap, quicksale, etc).
        
--------

**II**. You cannot offer or request money/non RL item exchanges on the subreddit OUTSIDE of the stickied [Anything-Goes thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/9vs8di/29_anything_goes_and_price_checking_threads/). (Paypal, gift cards, etc). You cannot make wager matches, blind trading posts/trading games, raffle posts, item begging posts, offer/request boosting/coaching services, or account sell/mod anywhere on this subreddit.
        
--------

**III**. Whether you are posting an item up for trade, or offering on a post by another user, you MUST keep all conversations out in the open to ensure all users are liable for their actions. No PM’ing or asking users to PM you to negotiate a deal outside of the ATG thread. Listing platform gamertags, IDs, friend codes, or references to negotiating elsewhere is not allowed.
        
--------

**IV**. You can only make one post every half hour to avoid spam abuse. Usage of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban of the alt and a 7 day minimum for the main account.

--------

**V**. Do not harass other users. Flaming (insulting users directly, name-calling, hate speech) may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from the subreddit at a moderator's discretion.
        
--------

**VI**. Do not hijack active trades (no trade sniping). If you want to request or offer an item, do it on your own thread or wait until the offer has been declined or completed. This includes giving unwanted advice/tips on another user's sale (no price policing).
        
--------

**VII**. Giveaways and blueprint revealing/trade-up streams (or videos) must be planned with moderators before being promoted.

CallOfDutyMobile,Snoo_24940,Making friends in BR solo matches.,"Hi everyone! So today I played a solo BR match on the Isolated map. There were just three people remaining, myself and two other players. I came across one player and luckily I always have my voice chat set to ""all"" so in case someone want's to be friends, we can voice chat. So the guy I came across, he was friendly. I gave him my sniper and he gave me his AK 47. We talked a bit but then the other remaining person shot and killed me. Now I was wondering, is there a way for me to add the guy I befriended? I checked the match results, but obviously his name was not there, only the person that killed me. These kind of things are so rare in the game when you befriend someone in a solo BR match. 

Also, if my voice chat is set to all, do they hear me when we are in close proximity of each other, or can they hear me regardless of how far apart we are from each other?

And would love to hear if any of you also made friends in solo BR matches. Have an awesome day!!",3,1,2023-02-07 13:02:03,2023,2

DestinyTheGame,Last_Room_2247,Does Touch Of Malice need a change?,"Like the titles says, Does ToM need a change?
Im not talking about a damage buff. More about a change to make it a bit more viable in harder content?

Im playing grandmasters, raids, etc. But i never have the feeling i can really run ToM. Damage for a primary is good ofc. But the downside of this gun is that it is damaging the user. 

You have to stand in a rift,well or having devour. But you have to stand still. With devour you can run around, but if youre damaging yourself, and a teammate kills the target you end up without having the health regen of devour.  In master and grandmaster content were you are underleveled. And were it is harder to deal damage. Is the content where the gun should shine imo. And it doesnt cause of the high risk. 



MY IDEA:

Let ToM self damage only affect your shield and not your health. So you cant kill yourself. And still run around with the gun. 

You would still be weaker cause of the shield damage. And need to look for cover in higher content. But you would be able to kill stronger enemies in high end content without risking to kill yourself. And would make this gun be more viable in more difficult scenarios. 

But maybe it is OP idk. I think it would be a good change

DestinyTheGame,NylesRX,Difficulty changes poll,"EDIT: This poll is pre-7.0.0.7 hotfix. If you feel like it didn't change your experience much, go ahead and vote, otherwise feel free to ignore.

Since this is a pretty volatile issue, I thought it would be a good idea to have some more information on it. I made a poll in which you can voice your opinion and specify how you engage in the game. The point of this poll is to provide a starting point for future discussions.

That way we'll be able to narrow down the issues more step by step, instead of making countless complaint posts. Hopefully it will provide a clear image for everyone. All changes are afterall meant to help the game in the long run.

I'm sure Bungie has a way of gathering this data but I also think it's good for the community to be able to clearly communicate with itself. So, cast your votes for everyone to see. Let me know if you have any ideas for improving if I missed anything. Share this poll beyond reddit if you can, we'd want to avoid as much bias as possible.

Is the sunbracers build still worth it? Mine has a base stat of 48.",14,0,2023-03-30 13:54:02,2023,3
FIFA,Schacke,I made a team purely based on high reactions and this is what i found.,"So, as the title says I made a team around having high reactions on every single player. The team ended up looking like this: [https://www.ea.com/fifa/ultimate-team/web-app/?showoffId=iJ8ZbfxvcKgf:FFA23PS5](https://www.ea.com/fifa/ultimate-team/web-app/?showoffId=iJ8ZbfxvcKgf:FFA23PS5)

The average reactions is 93,9. It could definitely be a bit higher, but i only used players costing a maximum of 200k while also focusing on having full chem. 

The goal with this team was never to have the highest reactions possible on all my players, but just to find out if you're able to feel the high reaction as I wasn't exactly sure what the stat did. I've used the team in numerous Rivals and Champs games and tbh i still don't exactly know what the stat does, but I do have some thoughts either way. 

**Reactions feel more important when defending:** What i would call AI-based interceptions felt stronger with these players. I got the ball back more often by doing less than i would've else done. 

**Animations didn't feel delayed:** Not to be confused with input delay (often a server issue) players can experience animation delays or maybe rather animation drag-outs. You see the animation starting but it takes longer than usual. This clearly didn't feel as prevalent with this team.

**High reactions on goalkeepers is really underrated:** This might sound obvious, but the reaction stat isn't a 'goalkeeper stat', so a lot of people might overlook it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:** I don't think i found anything substantial, but making this team was a good excuse to try out some different players. I would definitely recommend TOTT Kane, FF Ricken, FS Badiashile and WC Cech. Since high reactions isn't a very common attribute i wouldn't recommend sacrificing other important qualities for it, but it would be a good idea to consider it when comparing two otherwise similar players.",36,104,2023-03-30 13:54:26,2023,3

pokemongo,KortenScarlet,The upcoming spring event made me realize I want two things,"With the upcoming spring event containing so many costume pokemon and also an emphasis on rapid egg hatching, I realized there are two things I wish were possible to do in the game that are currently not possible:

1. **An option to remove event costumes.** I feel like any time an event with costumes rolls by, I sigh and reduce the costumed pokemon to the lowest priority to catch during my walks. I hunt for 100%IVs and perfect PVP IVs, but when I find a 100%/perfectPVP costumed pokemon, I just feel disappointed, not only because they usually can't be evolved, but also because I just really don't like the costumes. I can't think of a downside to at least having the option. Players who like the costumes can keep playing as usual.

2. **A toggle for receiving eggs.** I wish it was possible to decide when you want to receive eggs from stops, gifts, rocket leaders etc (doesn't have to be separate toggles for each, even just a general toggle), for a few reasons:

* When it comes to events like the upcoming spring event, it would be nice to hatch all your existing eggs and keep the egg inventory empty before the event arrives, so you can focus on event egg hatching as soon as it starts.
* It would be nice to be able to prioritize adventure sync eggs without having to avoid rocket leader fights.
* It would be nice to be able to prioritize 7km eggs from gifts without having to worry about spinning stops.
* It would be nice to be able to prioritize 12km eggs from rocket leaders without having to worry about other egg sources.
* In general, often times the egg hatching animation occurs too late, and you get an unwanted egg in its place before you realize the previous has hatched, despite waiting for the right moment to get a unique one.

pokemon,Seetheteor,Game Balance Idea: An Attempt to Adjust Pokémon Type Effectiveness,"Alright, let me explain briefly. I'm just a game player who intends to study game balance. Recently I spent some time adjusting Pokémon's type effectiveness charts. The main goal is to make the types more balanced and some types should be more distinctive (and usable).

At least, I personally think there are some problems with the type effectiveness in current games, which have been the case since GEN6. Frankly speaking, I've made 8 revisions during the recent time (Partly because of feeling too bored at my job, and I usually find opportunities to leave work early). These charts I'm about to present is my 8th modified version. Please trust me, I'm not changing for the change's sake.

My design proposal will be uploaded as some pictures, just below. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion. Looking forward to your feedback. Besides, I'm not a good English user, so please point them out if my words are misleading or... incorrect. Thanks.

Think: Anti-scorch reduces scorch in an area, Anti-jolt acts like an overload if jolted, anti-volatile heals enemies affected by volatile in an area, anti-freeze just makes nearby enemies unfreezable. That would make buildcrafting even more fun thinking about the enemies countering you. They could be used in instances where the burn sets up a scenario for excessive damage, countering elements in places they were buffed. This could also make more players actively choose support. Lots to play with once all of these new aspects and fragments drop alongside lightfall, and intertwining enemies with our subclasses could add yet another level to the system.",3,0,2023-02-03 09:23:02,2023,2

Genshin_Impact,xojavi_ugjuj,"Not the ending we wanted, but the ending that was needed","I just finished the Scaramouche interlude quest and boy do I have to say. Its a big plot twist. Granted I already saw leaks that he was going to become a playable character but I just assumed he was going to have his mind erased or have his body transplanted in another vessel since he is a puppet, and wow was I precise. Im pretty late in saying this I know but I wanted to get it out of my chest.

I just wanna clarify a few things that made me understand a bit more about him. I was a bit of a Scaramouche hater at first but understanding ones back story is how we can truly acknowledge ones character.

1. He was a victim to begin with just like anyone who serves the Fatui. Think about it, when we first met Collei, we got some backstory of her  when we spoke to Tighnari and how she was diagnosed with Eleazar as a kid and was taken to the fatui for treatment. Instead she got experimented and injected with god residue that made her go berserk. Even in the stories with the Chasm, after the whole Sea god incident in Liyue, they abandoned their members that were in the Chasm and Signora even manipulated Childe to her own extent, and manipulated the whole Vision Hunt decree in order to tear Inazuma from the inside out. They prey on the vulnerable only to seek profit for themselves. We even see how in the manga, Dottore tried to have Monstadt in the palm of his hand by demanding a treaty from them signed.

2. As much as I’d like to see him as an antihero, hes not really a good samaritan or a troublemaker. He just follows orders from Nahida. She gave him a second chance when not even Traveller wanted to. And in that moment of brief exchange, even decided to turn a new leaf to find some new purpose in life. Basically, Nahida is teaching him to socialize among human society. We even saw this on his birthday card when he said he was told to participate in a cooking class. Its kind of cute but even Nahida wants to see if he can try these to get a better understanding of human society.

3. Scaramouche receiving his vision proves that he is human. It is heavily theorized that anyone with anemo visions signifies that they have lost something or someone precious to the individual, we see this with Kazuha and Xiao. Scaramouche lost his own friend, his sanity, and his will to be free, all taken from Dottore. He might sound insouciant and not really care but hes actually putting in this Tsundere act just to keep his own personality. But he does care. His feelings for attempting to rewrite history, trying to save everyone from the dangers when he was still Kabukimono, shows that even pain, consideration, and just though of having emotion or sympathy for others, shows him to be human. Homunculus or not, he chose the path he wanted to do to make amends for his past actions due to manipulation. I mean hell, he even said sorry to Paimon when she got confused about him questioning if he would lose to his own god machine.

So it was a great experience, and his gameplay is awesome! My only single regret was not pulling for him but Im saving up for him now since I got to play him that quest. Hes super fun! And can fly!!! Very convenient. I took a break for a few months because of school and work but as a returning player, Im eager to see his rerun. P.s. heres hoping I get to see him in a future event from Sumeru.

Eldenring,Donagh04wilson,I'm sick of you little freaks,"I'm fucking SICK of you little vigour obsessed gremlins. There are other stats! Do you not want cool weapons?! Do you know you can dodge!? Why do you screech from the rafters that a build doesn't even exist if it, god have mercy, has ONLY 50 vigour.

Every single time someone asks about vigour all of you crawl out of your hermit crab-like vigour shells and proclaim any build worth its salt absolutely MUST have 60 vigor. Some of you even say you should get 40 BEFORE YOU LEVEL ANY OTHER STAT. 

Maybe you wouldn't need to survive that much against a boss if you did any damage. No one move in ng (except half of Malenias moves) is hard to dodge AND one shots you at like 35 vigor with decent armour. You also don't have to waste time double chugging flask like an alcoholic father. Don't just try and recall the days of havel and just stand there while you get hit.


Listen, I get it. We all like not dying. I get that players that struggle to dodge need a safety net. But please understand that there is more to life then vigour. You can be and do so much more with those ten or fifteen or, hell, maybe even twenty points. Get into power stancing. Armour up with endurance. Do a silly little twirl with a dagger. Fucking kamehameha a bitch, I don't care. Just please remember,  next time someone asks for build tips, or asks ""what vigor should I have by altus"" just stop and think. Do they need those last ten points? Should they do a little bit of damage minmaxing. Maybe get some defense and offense by leveling endurance for that knights armour?

Thank you all for reading, and please, give some thoughts to those other 7 stats. They might just make your day


This has been a PSA

Edit: as you all come out of the woodwork to condemn me let me remind you that I didn't say to not level vigour. But you can level it equally with other stats",96,0,2023-02-03 09:28:17,2023,2

It’s small but with build crafting changing the way it is in lightfall I feel like this could help a lot of new players with some headaches, myself included since I myself still forget and throw it on when it does nothing for my build.

And Maliketh has already accepted the golden order can't be restored and if you gave him all 9 death roots maybe you might be able to give up the death rune without having to kill him.

Eldenring,Scylax_Vitarrn,I’m not sure I understand how people say split damage is bad.,"If you do split damage the numbers equal the same 

Physical: 500             l              750
Resist: 10%                l              10%


Magic: 250                 l              0
Resist: 10%                 l             10%

Total: 675                   l              675        

The only times these numbers change is if the resistances are different. But that could help you if enemies are weak to elements. 

If they aren’t weak to it it’s a slight loss but nothing major. Only if your bigger number goes against the bigger resistance. 

In all honesty split damage is actually better because of the diverse resistances you face. You keep it more even across enemies instead of hard capping your damage into one category.

If we want to see videos subbed, we'll often end up having to wait for a reuploader.

Well, while I was working on story guides for Star Rail and Genshin, I ended up coming across a solution. This nifty thing called viewsync basically plays two videos synchronised, and the link is shareable. The only disadvantage is that you can't fullscreen it.

So here's some links prepared. All you need to do is turn off the sound on the English version and turn on subtitles, and you can watch the video in the dub you prefer:

DestinyTheGame,dark1859,"tower thoughts, the radial mast was just a ploy to get our ghost into position the whole time","The question that's been going across most players mind for a little while now has been why did the witness need the radial mast if it could just possess our ghosts to make the link the whole time. And after thinking on it for a little while I think I finally hit upon the answer: it didn't, it needed someone or something linked directly to the traveler to do so.

So then why make a big deal out of the mast if it was completely useless was the next question 

Well I think that has to do with what the witness knows about us as a guardian. We quite literally stick our nose every minor problem, dispute, and world ending scenario that stumbles within a 50 mi radius of our path. If you quite literally whispered the phrase threat to humanity, or worse shiny new gun we are not only front and center but literally shoving everyone out of the way to get first dibs on the latest threat to the solar system.

And while The radial mast might have been capable of doing something to the veil, I think it in reality was actually just plan b on the very remote chance we for once in literally the entire history of our 4-year-old with a gun mentality decided not to butt in. I think it's why we were able to intercept the ""private""message between the witness and his least favorite disciple. The witness didn't give a damn about either the mast or calus, they were just the most convenient excuse to get our meddling behinds into the room with the veil.

I also don't think the witness intended to sacrifice calus for its plan initially as the radial mast was bait enough to get our behinds where they needed to be, but once the shiny bait was a crumpled pile of scrap metal the witness needed a new set of shiny keys to dangle in front of us like a cat and his newest and least favorite disciple just so happened to be that pair of keys given how many times we've budded our nose into his business.


Now as for why the witness couldn't just go there and lure us there himself? Yeah I got no idea maybe he had to stay put and keep the traveler stuck where it was or something, I really don't know. I just assumed they had to keep the traveler locked in place or something which somehow in a convoluted manner means they couldn't go deal with it themselves beyond the occasional edgy holo message. Could also be on completely wrong about the witness not wanting to dispose of their latest disciple and it was also as a bonus and attempt to get rid of him so he'd stop quite literally annoying him with every step and breath he took.


TLDR The radial mast was just a pair of shiny keys the witness was dangling in front of us to get us where it needed us to be. And then, calus became that pair of shiny keys once we blew up the mast.",53,139,2023-03-31 13:47:03,2023,3

DestinyTheGame,FloXtiX,idea for better titan darkness super (strand and stasis),"I’ve already seen many debates about the new strand titan super because not many people (including me) are thrilled about it. The identity and fantasy of a titan has been extensively discussed there, so I just want to propose two more interesting super Ideas, that have a bit more range or are more in the category of single burst damage / “set it and forget it”.

First a rework of the upcoming strand super:

1. Titan summons a tonfa in each hand and can roam around for how long the super lasts. While in this form you chaining light attacks gaining a stack of woven mail or some other buff with each kill. 
2. You can manually end the super with heavy attack, sticking the two tonfas together, creating a spear and throwing it after a medium cast animation in a straight line.
3. The spear tangles red and orange bars as it passes through them and does some damage. If it hits a yellow bar or enemy guardian it prices with a base damage + the stacks you collected are converted into additional damage.

* Thought behind it: Many animations can be somewhat reused and it would be a hybrid between the planned roaming super and something, that can be used for big single hit boss damage, which is what we need the most imo. 

The second idea was a second super for stasis titans:

1. Imagine a titan summoning a big stasis crystal above his head and throwing it a short distance. 
2. Wherever it lands it will crush or push enemies aside and freeze everything in a radius around it. 
3. The crystal can’t be easily destroyed and will persist for a while like the bubble does. It will give you and teammates in a zone around it the resistance buff and increased class ability cooldown. Also enemies who enter the zone will get the slowed debuff and slowly freeze.

I don’t expect any of this being implemented, just needed to get it out of my mind.",1,0,2023-02-24 12:51:00,2023,2

RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,Feelin' Good Friday,"“Trading isn’t the same any more”

“Why is this subreddit growing, I don’t like new people”

“Why won’t my Wonderments sell they look so much better than White Zombas they should be worth 50,000 credits”

I may have exaggerated a bit but those are the sort of posts we here at RLE are seeing regularly. There’s too much negativity and not enough positivity on the sub.

So with that in mind, I have decided to begin a weekly series of posts aimed at sharing positive experiences that people have had. And what better day to do it than Friday when the week’s all but over and you’re on a break from all the hard work I know you’ve been doing?

This is a platform where you can share that happiness that you get when you find a long sought after item or when you make a good friend through trading or when you only just break even after spending a lot on a Striker Zomba Set ^^meirl

Stories don’t just have to be limited to RL, you can share any and all positive occurrences that have happened to you recently!

I’ve rambled on enough now, so let’s get the weekend started with Feelin’ Good Friday :)",0,5,2023-02-24 13:00:19,2023,2
RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,[Meta] Subreddit Rules,"Subreddit Rules
        
**I**. Your post MUST include [H] for ""Have"", and [W] for ""Want"". You must also include the platform you're planning to trade in. No Shitposts. Use /r/RLEMemes for memes.

Good title example:
[PC] [H] Pink Zomba Wheels [W] Offers

Bad title example:
Anyone want to trade for Frostbite??

You can also use [Discussion], [Meta], [Question], [Auction], [Price Check], and [Store] as tags.

Your item must be able to be traded at the moment of posting, no fake posts. You must own the item(s) and platform(s) you are posting (no posting for friends etc). Trades cannot be influenced on wording (cheap, quicksale, etc).
        
--------

**II**. You cannot offer or request money/non RL item exchanges on the subreddit OUTSIDE of the stickied [Anything-Goes thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/9vs8di/29_anything_goes_and_price_checking_threads/). (Paypal, gift cards, etc). You cannot make wager matches, blind trading posts/trading games, raffle posts, item begging posts, offer/request boosting/coaching services, or account sell/mod anywhere on this subreddit.
        
--------

**III**. Whether you are posting an item up for trade, or offering on a post by another user, you MUST keep all conversations out in the open to ensure all users are liable for their actions. No PM’ing or asking users to PM you to negotiate a deal outside of the ATG thread. Listing platform gamertags, IDs, friend codes, or references to negotiating elsewhere is not allowed.
        
--------

**IV**. You can only make one post every half hour to avoid spam abuse. Usage of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban of the alt and a 7 day minimum for the main account.

--------

**V**. Do not harass other users. Flaming (insulting users directly, name-calling, hate speech) may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from the subreddit at a moderator's discretion.
        
--------

**VI**. Do not hijack active trades (no trade sniping). If you want to request or offer an item, do it on your own thread or wait until the offer has been declined or completed. This includes giving unwanted advice/tips on another user's sale (no price policing).
        
--------

**VII**. Giveaways and blueprint revealing/trade-up streams (or videos) must be planned with moderators before being promoted. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7tc0wv/meta_a_rule_change_about_self_promotion/). Streams may only be promoted once per month by active users of the subreddit after moderator review.

**VIII**. If you were scammed, report them through [ModMail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRocketLeagueExchange) with proof. Do not post about being scammed unless you've contacted ModMail for permission and that person has been added to the [Scam List](https://rltracker.pro/scam_list).

I would also love wacky buffs like the fireteam has to all run Rat Kings for an extra buff or Telesto!

It would be a fun incentive to do a raid this way esp if the raid is going into the DCV. 

My one complaint about Bungie is they have this great game and they won’t let themselves have fun with it. Break a few rules! Color outside the lines! What does it matter between now and Monday?

With the effects being just always active the artifact really feels like a proper part of a build rather than an inconvenient grind to get mods. I just really hope Bungie leans full into the skill tree fantasy and lets us respec each node individually instead of having to reset fully in a future update.

His passes magically bends from my defenders to the running mbappe.

My passes got magically sucked to his feet, especially after i won the the ball from one attacker and try to play it carefully out.

Atleast one time he is through and he dont miss a 1vs1.

And the worst he is in nearly 80% of the enemy teams. - I wish there would be some limitation to weekend league like one icon per team, only x players above 90 rating, but that would shrink EAs revenue :/

Small Bore, Accurized Rounds, Eye of the Storm, Rangefinder/Opening Shot  
Stability MW

Since it came out I had about 35 drop from world and playlists. Nothing to keep for use there.

Focused a bunch of umbral engrams last season and got mixed results with the drops regarding the perk and trait mix.

Focused farmed it thru the HELM season of plunder vendor Suros umbral engrams this week and got two Cantatas from 25 umbral engrams.

There was a decent drop among this:  
Small Bore, Flared Magwell, Compulsive Reloader, Opening Shot  
Range MW.

It’s great to use, but the slicker one is still out in the wild.

Genshin_Impact,Different_Mistake_69,I can't stress this enough how much the community sh*ts on Cyno ...,"Whenever Cyno is mentioned on a video about Cyno or even a post about Cyno ... some people starts to sh\*t on him saying the same thing - ""oh keqing and yae miko outdpses Cyno"" ...

I know 2/4 of the community knows how good Cyno QuickBloom is but... there are few people who just tend to ignore it and starts saying things that doesn't even make sense like - ""Keqing and Yae QuickBloom is better"".

I remember seeing a comment saying that Keqing QuickBloom out damages Cyno QuickBloom and then posts a chart showing that Keqing's team dmg is 67k while Cyno is 60k....Once I opened the chart , I saw that Keqing was getting way more external buffs than Cyno was. Plus showing numbers on chart doesn't means sh\*t... Getting the perfect rotation to achieve the number is impossible.. and later I found that the guy was a Keqing Main... 

Many people just tend to like ""doomposts"" about Cyno... They think that Cyno doesn't feel good on Aggravate and hence he is worse than Keqing as a unit himself... This is something that angers me a lot. 

I have both Keqing and Cyno in my account and I tested out Aggravate ,Hyperbloom and QuickBloom.. On Aggravate , Keqing felt better but Cyno was able to clear out as fast Keqing.. But on Hyperbloom and QuickBloom , Keqing felt so bad... the teams was fine but ... it was so bad..  Cyno performed way WAY better than Keqing on that team archetype. 

I know the difference between Pull Value and Power level . I know Cyno's pull value isn't high but half of the community undervalues his Power Level by a lot.. 

This post isn't about saying that Cyno is better than Keqing . This post about the misconception about Cyno's powerlevel by the community..",160,10,2023-02-24 13:16:29,2023,2

pokemon,MasterOfChaos72,What is a Pokémon that you like but don’t see yourself using on a playthrough team?,"Just something that came to mind. To get a bunch of obvious ones out of the way: Trade Evolutions (Dusknoir if you wanna be specific). Most of the time, if I use them, it’s because they’re available in the game without requiring a trade. I think the only one I’ve used that required trading was an Alakazam.

Another one for me is Kantonian Ninetales. Nothing against it, it’s just that there are a lot of great fire types and Ninetales is just low on the power level for me. Plus it’s usually caught a decent bit into the game so I’m probably not going to be interested by that point.",47,13,2023-02-24 13:17:38,2023,2

Eldenring,CorpseTornado,Ranni's Ending's Meaning Briefly Explained," ELDEN RING:  Ranni the Witch

Ranni's ending seems to have people who theorize about the game confused.  The entire game is a set of manifold allegories.  Ranni the Witch glimpsed the full moon and her destiny was changed.  Her spell ""Ranni's Dark Moon"" tells you her destiny, which she aggressively chases after, and if you choose her ending you see it.  She speaks of a ""Thousand year journey under the wisdom of the moon..."" and ""I would leave this soil behind... abandoning the certainties of faith and touch... into fear, doubt, and loneliness""  

You have to kill her deranged brother who has ""arrested the cycle of the stars"" with gravity magick.  Then she kills her Two Fingers which was the last oppressive force tethering her to this world.  She even ""abandons her body"".

This is all an allegory for the moon breaking orbit with Earth, which is signified by her father Radagon (red=earth), and he also happens to possess the Elden Ring.  Abandoning the soil to go on a thousand year, uncertain and lonely journey under the wisdom of the moon, free from the influence or GRAVITY of the Greater Will and other controlling forces.  A dark moon is one that is floating through space and not orbiting anything.

I said manifold, meaning there's another entire interpretation(s) that doesn't step on the toes of this one.  But I'll go ahead and save that for another time, Elden Ring goes way deep, like the roots of the Great Tree.  Praise the Sun. I MEAN FINGERS!  
PS: There's a few more connections I left out because I hate when there's nothing left to figure out when reading stuff like this.  Leaves you with nothing to do at your desk ;)",4,0,2023-02-24 13:22:41,2023,2

Eldenring,fantasyfootball991,Bestial incantations are under tuned for PVE.,"I’m nearing the endgame with a strength/faith build focused around bestial incantations/weapons and found them to be quite underwhelming (other than the hammer). Which is a shame because getting all the Death roots is a pain. 

The incantations themselves don’t seem like they’d be much use in NG+ and beyond because they don’t do enough damage or % damage like some other incants. Both beast claw incants are meh so I’m better off using the weapon art on the beast hammer. The dagger boosting the incants by 10% is nice but not enough to make it extremely useful. I just wish the dagger was a regular smithing stone upgrade so it could be buffed with weapon buffs. 

Out of all the beast incants the stone is the only one that is slightly better than meh which I think is a real shame. Seems to me the beast incants are geared more toward early/mid game and not NG+ or higher. Maybe they shine in PVP but I don’t play that mode. 

Overall the entire bestial school is pretty underwhelming, I hope it gets buffed in the next patch because aesthetically they’re such neat abilities.",5,13,2023-03-30 11:53:05,2023,3

Here's how this post works:

Tell everyone what you're trading up (rares, very rares, imports, exotics), and then tell everyone what you get! Even if it's not good (in your eyes), you may end up striking gold by getting the last piece of someone's coveted set! 

If you don't have a tradeup to do right now, feel free to share a recent tradeup you did over the past week instead to participate

###Special thanks to u/W1ndyC1tyFlyer for his [original idea!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/b3s2fy/discussion_tradeup_thursday/)",1,5,2023-03-30 12:00:12,2023,3
RocketLeagueExchange,AutoModerator,[Meta] Subreddit Rules,"Subreddit Rules
        
**I**. Your post MUST include [H] for ""Have"", and [W] for ""Want"". You must also include the platform you're planning to trade in. No Shitposts. Use /r/RLEMemes for memes.

Good title example:
[PC] [H] Pink Zomba Wheels [W] Offers

Bad title example:
Anyone want to trade for Frostbite??

You can also use [Discussion], [Meta], [Question], [Auction], [Price Check], and [Store] as tags.

Your item must be able to be traded at the moment of posting, no fake posts. You must own the item(s) and platform(s) you are posting (no posting for friends etc). Trades cannot be influenced on wording (cheap, quicksale, etc).
        
--------

**II**. You cannot offer or request money/non RL item exchanges on the subreddit OUTSIDE of the stickied [Anything-Goes thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/9vs8di/29_anything_goes_and_price_checking_threads/). (Paypal, gift cards, etc). You cannot make wager matches, blind trading posts/trading games, raffle posts, item begging posts, offer/request boosting/coaching services, or account sell/mod anywhere on this subreddit.
        
--------

**III**. Whether you are posting an item up for trade, or offering on a post by another user, you MUST keep all conversations out in the open to ensure all users are liable for their actions. No PM’ing or asking users to PM you to negotiate a deal outside of the ATG thread. Listing platform gamertags, IDs, friend codes, or references to negotiating elsewhere is not allowed.
        
--------

**IV**. You can only make one post every half hour to avoid spam abuse. Usage of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban of the alt and a 7 day minimum for the main account.

--------

**V**. Do not harass other users. Flaming (insulting users directly, name-calling, hate speech) may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from the subreddit at a moderator's discretion.
        
--------

**VI**. Do not hijack active trades (no trade sniping). If you want to request or offer an item, do it on your own thread or wait until the offer has been declined or completed. This includes giving unwanted advice/tips on another user's sale (no price policing).

VALORANT,Beneficial_Door9099,"What does ""Wa"" mean and why is it used for the Valorant China limited edition card?","The Valorant is to be launched on the China server, and different from other servers, there are limited edition cards offered ... Then I looked and saw a Chinese character ""Wa"". I once learned a little Chinese. Actually, this is a simple character but not widely used. It says online that the meaning is ""tile"", but I don't understand the connection between it and the Valorant. So I asked my Chinese teammate. He said that Chinese characters are pictographic. In ancient Chinese, this character means ""precision"", because the dot in the middle represents the crosshairs.

I thought, wow, it is so cool!!!  Later I showed this off to one of my other Chinese classmates, but he has some different explainations about the character. He said ""Wa"" means ""to completely defeat the enemy.""

To be honest, I don't know which one is correct. Or both of them are right? At first, I thought it was Chinese calligraphy, limited edition, something like artwork. But now I'm starting to wondering maybe the two versions of explainations are both tricking me...

What do you think?

VALORANT,giggle_stickz,How do I deal with smurfs,"Any advice on how to deal with smurfs in silver/gold lobbies?

Over the past 2 to 3 weeks I have encountered smurfs in almost all of my games and very seldom they are in my team. I only report them after the game when their combat score is roughly double that of the nearest players. Not that I think it helps but I feel a little bit better.

It is really hard to counter someone with a 20+ kill lead and 95% headshot rating.

They destroy my kd on my account to the point where I am playing in bronze lobbies when I solo queue as s2.

pokemon,careless_swiggin,"Rarest pokemon possible, in any game [S/V]","Many event pokemon are rare, but with marks, which may or may not be more common on shiny pokemon, there is no rarer pokemon to capture, or breed in S/V 

Very large or Very small, shiny family of 3 mouse, triple dun or authentic tea, with the rare mark ""the Recluse"" but that is for wild capture, which moushold doesn't have yet, you'd have to evolve it from a shiny prevo with that mark 

the odds are  1: 6,763,315,200,000. They are likely to never exist naturally

even with sandwich, charms, breeding, outbreaks or less rare marks, it would still be in the 10-20 billions to one, to find a specific combo. tiny/giant huntng is 1/16512 with nothing to aid it, sandwiches aid shiny and marks, nothing aids rare forms or proportions.

Even shiny hunting a 3 piece dundun shiny would be very hard, but possible, but getting a specific mark and size makes them impossible, let alone some marks can overlap, but i'm not sure if there is limits. (your pokemon can be huge, and not have the huge mark since it has maxed love and like's clouds, etc), If there is a crazy amount of marks possible, it could balloon up millions more in rarity.",2,15,2022-11-28 09:08:37,2022,11

Is there an explanation for this happening or is it just a big coincidence?

FIFA,Petaaa,Brazil 1970 tactics 18-2 fut champs,"#Background
Ref https://www.fmscout.com/a-brazil-1970-tactic-recreation-fm20.html

Brazil had an influx of number 10s within their squad/shape and you could say this influenced Zagallo to play all of Brazil’s best under one tactic. The front two (Tostão &amp; Pelé) didn't play as typical 'strikers'. Both players had drop deeper into midfielder areas collecting the ball but this meant Brazil now had no main influence or target inside the box. Given the quality of attacking players, this was not needed. Tostão was very smart with his movements, he would drop into deeper areas, this allowed Pelé, no denying was the star of the show, had made similar movements and this created wonderful interchanges where all attackers could benefit from the space created by the two. He was the prime playmaker, whilst Tostão resembled more of a false 9. 

Rivelino (LW) played more as a typical winger, though a natural Attacking Midfielder, He would/could play more narrow, not only creating a slight overload with Pele and Gerson, but also created a three-man midfield with the two central midfielders as Revelino would also drop deeper. 

Jairzinho (RW) had pace like no other! Using his pace to exploit open spaces created by, mainly Tostão, and get into very good goalscoring positions. He would often make the run from wider into inside positions but his off-the-ball movement was just as great as his skills on the ball. On the ball, he terrorised opposition defences when running at them

In goal was Félix, Carlos Alberto was a very offensive wing back, constantly up and down the flank. With Jairzinho looking to make the run inside meant Carlos Alberto mostly had the flank to himself, not to forget, he was the captain of the side. Everaldo was a lot more cautious than Carlos Alberto and this brought excellent balance with the back 4. Piazza was a defender who was VERY comfortable on the ball and understandable, as naturally he was a Midfielder. Brito was more a standard CB at the time, you could say he had least skill in the team but that would be unfair to say Clodoaldo and Gérson operated as the midfield pivot, Gerson was another creative player in this Brazil set-up but he could create play from deeper positions, not only keeping the team ticking in deeper areas but had the vision to pick out some outrageous passes. Clodoaldo was more the tough guy in midfield, looking to win the ball back for his team. Calling him a Ball-Winning-Midfielder may take away some of the quality he also possessed on the ball. With the left flank dominated by Rivelino and Tostao edging wide, the right-hand side of the pitch had a lot of space to be exploited. Naturally Jairzinho pushed inside despite his right-footedness, which left a lot of room for the onrushing captain, Carlos Alberto. Tostao and Pele were two number 10s upfront, but the later was the main playmaker and star of the show, while the other had a more pressing type role.

Brazil's build up from the back had to happen with some speed, not direct but with speed to get the ball to the more advanced and creative players. A lot of vertical passes from deeper areas but Brazil was very versatile with their play which made it almost impossible to defend or guess what was going to happen next. Players played with extreme flair and freedom, 'Capoeira' focused on free bodily movement, an Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music and this is how the players moved around the pitch, with freedom and elegance.

DestinyTheGame,The_Bygone_King,Everyone Is Sleeping on Stasis,"TL;DR at the end!

It’s the general community consensus that Stasis is in a weaker spot when compared to the other Light 3.0 reworks, excluding Shadebinder.  I wanted to explore some of the reasons why I think Stasis is actually one of the best designed classes present in the 3.0 system.

To begin, I’d like to first address the absolutely incredible choices that Stasis has access to with its fragments, choosing to first highlight Impetus.

Fragment of Impetus is one of those fragments that I very rarely see played, which I always find confusing given how stacked it actually is.  For those who don’t know, Impetus reloads your weapons and maxes out their handling for 5 seconds when you hit a target with a charged melee attack.  This fragment is especially potent on Revenant and Shadebinder, since those two melees are ranged.

What this enables stasis to do, is max out their weapon damage by mitigating long reloads.  Weapons like Gjallarhorn can be fired 4-6 times without reloading, and that’s not considering the maxed out handling that comes with the perk.

Other fragments on the class that I rarely see are fragments like Hedrons.  Hedrons has rarely seen play after its nerf back in the launch of Beyond Loght, however, the stat bonuses that this fragment provides are unrivaled among other options, even comparable to exotics like Ophidion Aspects.  Hedrons, provides various stat bonuses when you freeze a target.  Generally, Freezing targets is more available to Behemoth and Shadebinder, so these are the two classes that I think should run this fragment.  Here are the numbers for what this fragment does:

&gt;+60 to Mobility, Recovery, and Resilience, along with a large increase in weapon stability and aim assist.  Unfortunately, the resilience provided does not stack your damage resist, but it does increase your health total.

For -10 to Strength, you’re gaining 180 total in baseline neutral stats and an unknown amount of consistency stats on your weapon of choice.  In most standard Behemoth and Shadebinder builds, freezing something every 10 seconds is a reasonable feat, meaning these stats are essentially free for these classes.

Among the other fantastic fragment choices (seriously, none of these fragments are duds, they all have a place in any build and are highly competitive with each other for placements on a specific build), Stasis has access to one of the best class synergy mods in the game, Elemental Shards.  With Elemental Shards, your class neutral game now directly interacts with your armor mod engines.  I hear many like to compare this directly to elemental wells, but I disagree with that comparison, and here’s why.

When you play Elemental Wells, the well itself is largely divorced from your class.  It doesn’t interact with your fragments in anyway, as it only provides ability energy (and any CWL etc you’re pushing for).  Elemental Shards, however, enables you to push into CWL builds from an aspect investment, while still marrying the neutral game benefits of stasis shards with the class as a whole from fragments like Rime.

Furthermore, unlike most elemental well mods, you do not need to kill targets to generate stasis shards on Behemoth or Shadebinder.  This means that you can access CWL on these classes during boss fights without the need to farm adds.  On Shadebinder, just freeze the boss to generate your shards and on Behemoth just throw down a glacier grenade and break some of it.  As a result stasis can access some of the highest sections of damage a single target can deal by pairing the mods Font of Might with High-Energy Fire, as long as you opt to run Stasis heavy/special weapons.

I should add, shatter damage should not be ignored when considering your DPS.  Shatter damage is an additional 10% of the total damage dealt to the target before they shatter, and with certain fragments that number can be pushed to very high levels.  When paired with buffs like HEF+FOM, stasis can almost treat shatter like jolt from a DPS standpoint.

I should also add that stasis as a damage type is absolutely capable of clearing enemies efficiently by nature of shatter damage, or slowing enemies substantially.

This is only scratching the surface of what is available on the class, as with the power level of some of these fragments you’re open to a lot more than what you might expect on other classes.

&gt;*TL;DR:  While stasis has some lackluster aspects on a few classes, the fragments and the baseline flexibility of each class’ kit enables the class to play outside the realm of other classes.  Impetus as a fragment enables you push harder into DPS specs than most other classes can commit, while other aspects like Hedrons provide absurd stat penalties for low investment.  Elemental Shards provides a versatility not available to other classes as well.*

&gt;*Stasis is a well rounded archetype on all three classes that enables very specific builds for very specific classes.  Revenant for example can make use of Impetus to enable very fast billibilli loops that just aren’t possible in other classes.  Behemoth and Shadebinder intrinsically have access to CWL via their elemental shard options without needing to use Powerful Friends to do so.  All three classes have access to some of the most powerful fragments in the game, and all three classes can uniquely take advantage of them in different ways.*

&gt;*Stasis is a gun focused class, and it’s fragments reflect that beautifully.  It may not spam abilities as efficiently as Light subclasses, but the neutral game benefits to your gunplay are absolutely worth it.*

&gt;TL;DR for the TL;DR: Stasis good.  Damage good.  Stasis do damage.",391,720,2022-11-28 09:23:19,2022,11

pokemon,Vampxhelix,"Pokemon Violet/Scarlet 5 star raids need nerfs, seriously.","So, after playing violet and raiding for a week I've come to the conclusion that 5 star raids specifically lack any real balance and results impossible circumstances at worst, or at the very least is bad content. 4 star and below are easy enough to clear solo with a good Pokémon, and 6 star raids, being the end-game of end-game raids are appropriately difficult for what they are, although I've only done like 5-6 of them successfully. But this post is about the 5 star specifically.

Why do I think this? Here are my top 5 reasons.

1. 5 star raids are unlocked pre-post game BEFORE the Pokémon league, giving the player the idea that they are simply a modest step up from lvl 4s like 2-3 and 3-4 were. The game does NOT tell you that it is in fact an increase to lvl 75 pokemon, which outlevels all other in-game content including the league, the post-league champ fight and area zero content, and the tournament AFTER the credits. My complaint here is simple, don't give players content its impossible to do at the stage you unlock it. Why is it virtually impossible? See complaint 2.
2. In addition to being level 75, these 5 star Pokémon have insane stats, so insane that you not only need a perfect team of max-iv/max-ev lvl 100 Pokémon to pull it off consistently, but even that doesn't work half the time in online battles. How insane you ask? well I'm glad you did because I have some recent examples of how insane they really are. Two matches that came to mind were against a [Baxcalibur](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sv/baxcalibur/)(ice terra) and another being Orthworm(water terra):

2a. The first one I used a lvl 99 Tinkaton with perfect Ivs and evs, adamant nature because it resists ice and dragon type moves nicely. 270 attack with a steel move with base 160 power + stab. How much damage does this does this do? like maybe 5% hp to the dude. Now, Gigatonhammer being so powerful can only be used once every 2 turns, and only has 5 pp, so the most you can do with it is 25% of the health of the target by yourself. This is insanely low damage in my mind when compounded with all other things you gotta deal with(outlined later). This makes solo impossible with this pokemon, who should shit on this guy 10 ways to sunday with his type in a normal matchup.

2b. Now this second one is equally silly, but perhaps underlines a different issue. Orthworm being a steel type with water terra meant you could either bring bug, grass, or electric to fight it. Having grinded somewhat now that i've been in postgame for 4-5 days now, i decided to bring Leafeon lvl 100,(just assume i'm always using best iv/evs). Now you might say to yourself, ok well Orthworm has 145 base defense, and i'd say yeah that's like insanely good. But of course I only have so many level 100s to choose from and my guy is 25 levels above them and is terra grass with swords dance so i should be able to buff my way to some good damage. Well, boy was i wrong, even after two swords dances, i was doing like 1% of its hp with leaf blade. Now, according to pokemon damage calculator, at +3 to a normal oathworm(it coiled once) 25 levels below me, i'd be doing between 84-99% of its hp depending on the role. So i was doing like 1/84th of the % health damage I would expect, meaning its defense was so boosted that i was doing &lt; 3% of the damage i would normally do to that pokemon.

3. Taking into account these 2 examples which are just a couple of many I could talk about, this next complaint compounds this issue. I just gave examples of how defensively these terra raid Pokémon get insane buffs, but these buffs are offensive as well, meaning that if you get hit by something neutral and not resisted? Yeah you're probably getting 2-3 shot by that. Now I hear some people out there, ""just bring something that resists all its moves"", yeah...don't worry, we'll get to that later. So...given the hyper offense capability of a lot of these fully evolved pokemon(and god forbid they get a stat boosting ability like coil or calm mind), its finally time to talk about the actual mechanic of terra raids that makes this broken as all heck. Terra raids are real time, meaning that all players move at the same time for their attacks more or less and these inputs are buffered by relative speed against your opponent in order to determine the order of attack. Now, i was all for this system initially, not having to wait for everyone to go through their turn to attack? Brilliant! Except...they gave the terra pokemon the ability to do it also. So...from what i can tell, the tera raid pokemon on every interval (because no turns) will select an attack and hit EVERY pokemon at the same time on your team with it, and it calculates this damage value as if it is attacking a singular pokemon. This causes a few problems with a few different types of moves:3a. So, for those who dont know, moves like rockslide and surf and moves that attack multiple pokemon at once generally have some of their overall damage nerfed on each one individual to balance out the fact it hits everything, where Pokémon only receive full damage from the move when they are the only one being hit by it. Since terra Pokémon however perform their attack on an individual basis rather than a group hit with these moves, that means it is performing the full damage on each pokemon rather than splitting the damage. This means they are basically ignoring the mechanic of damage splitting.

3b.  Status moves, oh god here we go. So lets just start off with the obvious, if your opponent has sleep, para, or burn if you are physically, you are utterly fucked. Not only will they hit all players Pokémon with this ability, meaning that they can sleep your whole party in one interval but they can spam it multiple times between your ""turn"" ( see 4). good luck doing enough damage in the time limit with only 2 of your party doing damage/setting up.

3c. Single target attacks are just that, single target. they are balanced around hitting one person per turn. So obvious problem here when terra raid pokemon can hit 4 pokemon at the same time with a single target attack doing full damage to each of them. Coupled with #2s problem, and this means they are dishing out a crap ton of dps per interval.

4. So...you've seen me use the word interval to take the place of where a turn normally would. And here is my #2 reason that this system is dogshit. First things first, you better select the moveo you wanna do fast, because if you dont guess what your ""interval"" is getting skipped to play animations for everyone else and the terra pokemon. So pokemon, which is supposed to be tactical thinking now becomes a rush job to think what your next move will be as fast as possible. Now this is more of a nitpick because any good trainer knows what they are going to use most likely, but this next bit is unforgiveable. The timer will tick down even as animations play, and the terra raid pokemon has the unfortunate ability to do multiple things in succession before you are able to choose your next attack. These things include, using a move, removing any debufs, removing all YOUR buffs, putting its shield up, and stealing your terra orb charge. Oh, and the move if these animations are slow enough can cause them to use multiple moves back to back before you get to do anything. Oh what's that? you wanted to choose your attack? Well better wait 30 seconds for these animations to happen. And you wanted them to get one attack in for each one you deal? oh buddy, good luck with that because they might, idk double moonblast with double stat drop ya, or dragondance earthquake ya or my personal favorite, here have a yawn and then do some shit like coil or amnesia. So not only does this system eliminate any fairness in an attack for attack based game it just straight up ignores it. Also, want to terrastalize? well there's 20 seconds off your timer as you have to sit through the whole god dang animation.

5. And here we are long last at #5, and is somewhat related to the issue with #2. See, you really really need to resist the opponents attacks while at the same time having good offensive capability that matches the terra type needed to shield break them. Now there are 18 pokemon types in the game, with approximately 324 different type combinations when you take into consideration dual typing. Now not all dual types exists, so lets just call it an even 300, or even better lets just half it to make the point. 150 type combonations you gotta plan for defensively. You know what, multiple types will fill the defensive combinations for multiple types so lets bring that even lower to 50 different combinations that you got to plan for. Now these 50 pokemon that will cover every possible type you need to fight also need to have the correct terra type to fight them. For the sake of expediency, the average number of weaknesses a type possesses is about 3. So, to have all your bases covered to bring the best pokemon for the fight, you would need about 150 different pokemon to fulfill all these roles, and then multiply that number by 2 for special vs physicals users. so...300 different pokemon to cover those bases for perfect coverage. Obviously this is a bit ridiculous in practice, so when someone says, why don't you have that perfect typing for this specific pokemon that is why, i don't have 300 available box spots in my pc. So, they only thing to do realistically is try to get the best defensive coverage you can while still having an offensive threat, which 90% of the pokemon in the game currently currently just don't have. Don't require that level of perfection for content that is pre-post game. Heck don't require that level of perfection except for the hardest of lvl 6 raids. (Rip future charizard attempts)

So yes, this was long but I think I've pretty much covered the biggest issues with the lvl 5 raids. Overpowered stats, ridiculous mechanics for attacking, bad interval shenanigans, and many more.

My closing argument is this, I've seen idk how many people just bring 4 legendaries to these raids either on youtube or twitch or whatever to win these raids. They all use metal sound/screech to lower defenses, buff the attack then use the collision course/electric drift move to do big damage. So my point is this, If you need bring a big legendary stat-stick and win most raids regardless of typing with this strategy while almost all other Pokémon struggle to do good even with proper typing and stats, then that is either dogshit game balance or dogshit gameplay.

P.S Protip, if there is a ditto and you are hosting, dont select a stupid legendary for it to turn into, pick a stupid lvl 5 magicarp with splash so people can win the fight in 10 seconds.

It seems like an ability tacked on to something when they can't think of a more creative ability the same way that Pressure is tacked on to like half of legendaries. At the very least, those legendaries get a hidden ability but here's the major problem with Levitate; only Koffing line, Duskull, and Bronzor line get a hidden ability while the rest have Levitate as their only available ability. The lake trio had interesting powers in their lore but nope, they just get Levitate as their ability. Darkrai gets its signature ability Bad Dreams but Cresselia just gets Levitate. The Lati twins felt like they could have had a signature ability but nope, Levitate. You'd think Giratina Origin would have some exclusive ability but nope, Levitate. I wouldn't have as much problems with this ability if Gen 5 gave them a hidden ability but nope, they're stuck with it.",3,3,2022-11-28 09:47:44,2022,11

Eldenring,bluud687,Conspiracy traces on the fingerprint shield?,"If you have never noticed it, I would like to point out that traces of blood can be found on the shield in question

[ It's not something flashy, but if you look closely they are perfectly visible ](https://preview.redd.it/jbc55jy0wn2a1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=767e51c244e8811789edb8ff24e5598fd84e61b9)

The only link I can think of for this possible cause is the fingerslayer blade which also has traces of blood on its blade.  The description of the shield says this:  *Part of the tomb of an ancient god, the Readerless Fingers relayed their message through these imprints, said to be the very seeds from which frenzy first sprouted*

From here we can deduce that, according to this hypothesis, this conspiracy took place near a tomb of a god and that from this fact the flame of frenzy was born. Which god we currently can't know, but the tomb...I don't know, it vaguely reminds me of Farum Azula, which is also a gigantic mausoleum

However, if we want to continue on this hypothesis we must take into account an important detail: the fingerslayer blade can only be wielded by an empyrean. Not only that, it must be an empyrean who lived in the eternal cities...Marika, is that you?

That Farum Azula and the eternal cities are connected is not utopia, after all Marika has connections with both. Not only for the Numen (that comes from the eternal cities) and the statue of Marika (probably) in the Maliketh arena, but also for architectural reasons

[ These \\""gazebos\\"" are found in many areas of both Farum Azula and the Eternal Cities ](https://preview.redd.it/i2q89yo4yn2a1.jpg?width=2392&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=746f02def4ec471c6e95376da9e57920b8e95faa)

We know that probably the fingerslayer blade was the reason for the betrayal that led to being banished in the underground..and probably also the reason of the flame of frenzy gave its first signs of life

Forgive me if I misstate these reasonings, I'm just an abuser of google translate..just try to follow the reasoning",10,8,2022-11-28 09:52:21,2022,11

FIFA,Mamonos23,"FUT Black Friday ""review""","It was my first black friday on FUT. Everyone was talking about this event, I went fully into it and in my opinion it was very underwhelming. 

A part from the pack weight that many pointed out, that is ""subjective"" and we can discuss in other post (I can post my horrifying results), let's look at the offer of the event:

There where no discounts on FIFA Points. What would it cost to EA to give something like a 30-50%, like every company does? Make it even only for a single purchase.

There were no discounts on packs, but there were more available packs than usual. Basically, targeting addiction and whales.

There were some special packs (star player and 100 player) but they were very expensive and the items were untradeable. In the end, I would not say there was a single worthy pack apart from the 10 coins one (which at the end for 99% people was still a joke).

On top of this, they released tons of SBC, and if you look carefully none of these was actually a good deal but rather a way to waste 11 cards to get 1 or 2 back, hoping for a big pull, and then go back to the store to buy more packs to not ""miss out"" on the next ""big deal"".

Genshin_Impact,Meta3736,"Controversial take on Blizzard strayer: Don’t farm for it because it is good with freeze, farm for it because your Ayaka can use it","&amp;#x200B;

Even though people say Freeze is broken, if you just looked at amount freeze team that is being played, it pretty clear, only Ayaka version is used the most where Freeze comp is simply hard carried by Ayaka. The reason isn’t because reaction itself is bad, rather the end-game content we currently playing is making it look bad: freeze is incredible in AOE non boss scenario( aka Venti-able floors) but outside of it, the reaction no longer usable since it only affect enemies, not boss, who are usually in ST.

And here what makes Ayaka different from the packs, she works incredibly in ST, which combine with her front load burst damage, made her de facto Freeze DPS(in the current moment) who can work regardless of whether freeze works or not and it won’t change unless a freeze dps do it better or similar to Ayaka, since freeze is no longer de facto AoE comp; amount of comps ranging from Mono Pryo Klee, Double Anemo Aggravate, Burgeon to popular ones like Nilou bloom,International, Raiden Hyper(in FP2 Veteran to Dolphin investment) and AoE hyperbloom work incredibly well and give strict competition where only Ayaka ones is at least can complete with them.

TL;DR: Freeze is no longer broken from the moment ST scenario began to appear and stayed in both side of floor 12. Freeze is currently relevant because of Ayaka who can work regardless of Freeze shortcomings, so farm Blizzard strayer only for Ayaka( or future Freeze DPS units in the same position)",12,0,2023-03-03 10:08:58,2023,3

I’m currently running Shackle Grenades + Armamentarium with Thread of continuity + Thread of generation. Those are easily the strongest fragments and should be “must-haves” on any build.

I have two grenades that can each suspend champions and take them out of the fight with an increased duration thanks to Continuity. Then I also have the suspend from putting down my barricade as well, which is another group of enemies that I can CC at the same time. The combo gets even better as I can deal damage to keep getting my grenade back faster which just means more CCing opportunities. 

And the crazy part is that this isn’t even optimized! You still have two other fragments along with the mod system to boost this even further! I haven’t even checked how HoIL would do with this build since the Generation fragment already refreshes my grenades!

 So one day, me and my friends decided to 5 stack at like 3 am. We select ""Illinois"" servers because that's the best server for us (a team that is scattered all over the US).

We queue into a match and finally we get a look at the enemy team.....

The **ENTIRE** team is just named ""Iron Mastermind"". And **ENTIRE** team filled with smurfs that just want to go to low elo lobbies and give people a hard time. The entire time they were ragging on how bad we were.

Now hear me out, its nothing I've never heard before. Its Valorant. Unfortunately games are kind of just like this. 

But when they surrendered on round 5 we thought we were done... we thought we'd NEVER see them again...but no.... we queued up with them again...this happened ***THREE*** *TIMES*.

Finally we changed servers,,, and were blessed with the MOST WHOLESOME TEAMMATES...

DestinyTheGame,XboxUser123,(PvE) Arc Grenade Data and Why You May be Using the Wrong Grenade,"# Preface

I've noticed that Lightning grenades on titan are particularly powerful, yet I keep on seeing others oozing over Storm and Pulse grenades. I have decided to gather conclusive data on which grenade is the best and found some interesting results.

Note that the *Jolt* effect gives you a damage bonus which also applies to weapons in various degrees. I also believe it *only* buffs your damage and not allied damage.

The Spark of Shock fragment gives the Jolt effect to all grenades.

# Data

With Touch of Thunder (data relevant to titans)

|Grenade|Damage without Spark of Shock|Damage with Spark of Shock|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1x Lightning grenade\*|67425|42520|
|1x Pulse grenade\*\*|38493|50682|
|1x Storm grenade (average)|38822|51789|

&amp;#x200B;

Without Touch of Thunder (data relevant to non-titans)

|Grenade|Damage without Spark of Shock|Damage with Spark of Shock|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1x Lightning grenade\*|32355\*\*\*|42520|
|1x Pulse grenade|32948|45146|
|1x Storm grenade (observed)|15279|17312|

&amp;#x200B;

\* Lightning grenades seem to have a small AoE of damage on despawn:

|Modifier|Additional damage|
|:-|:-|
|Touch of Thunder|\+7122|
|Touch of Thunder + Spark of Shock|\+2033|
|Lightning grenade|NA (not recorded)|
|Lightning grenade + Spark Shock|\+2033|

Note that these additional values will *only* apply if you can land the grenade right next to the enemy hitbox, otherwise do not expect this additional damage.

\*\* collecting all ionic traces from pulse grenades with Touch of Thunder regenerates \~2/3 of your grenade energy back

\*\*\* this value is likely slightly lower, due to the small AoE damage not being recorded. Without the small AoE, it may be only around 1-2k less damage. Too lazy to figure it out, and it's fairly arbitrary.

# Remarks

**For Titans (Touch of Thunder)**

Interestingly, despite the nerfs and the recent pulse grenade buff, Storm grenades are still competitive with Pulse grenades with Touch of Thunder. On average, it would be expected that you would do slightly more damage with a Storm grenade than with a Pulse grenade, and especially so when considering a boss with a very large hitbox. Something interesting to note is that the exact damage becomes slightly less consistent with Touch of Thunder than without. However, pulse grenades have the benefit of regenerating \~2/3 of your grenade energy, provided you can collect all ionic traces generated.

Another interesting thing is that Spark of Shock actually *negates* the effects of Touch of Thunder for Lightning grenades—Lightning grenades with Touch of Thunder + Spark of Shock will actually do *less* damage than without Spark of Shock. Note that Lightning grenades + Touch of Thunder + Spark of Shock does equivalent damage to Lightning grenades + Spark of Shock.

Lightning grenades do *significantly* more damage than either Pulse or Storm grenades when considering Touch of Thunder. In addition, Touch of Thunder provides Jolt on initial blast *and* gives two Lightning grenades. The only disadvantages is that (1) they have a hitbox, meaning they may be easily destroyed by your explosives, non-allied explosives, non-allied projectiles, and boss-stomps; and (2) they require more alignment than Storm and Pulse grenades. Note that to make use of the increased damage, it is absolutely necessary for the initial blast to hit the target in order to apply Jolt on the initial blast.

**For non-Titans (Without Touch of Thunder)**

Storm grenades are hilariously bad for damage without Touch of Thunder.

Lightning grenades and Pulse grenades are practically interchangeable, dealing very similar damage, with only Pulse grenades doing only \~3k more damage when both grenades consider Spark of Shock. For ease of use, it may be best to stick with Pulse grenades.

# Conclusion

**For the titan with Touch of Thunder**, *absolutely* use Lightning Grenades ***without*** *Spark of Shock* for DPS. Otherwise, use Spark of Shock fragment with either Pulse grenades or Storm grenades, they are practically interchangeable. However, Pulse grenades would be better if you can collect the ionic traces generated.

**For the non-titan without Touch of Thunder**, use Spark of Shock with either the Pulse grenade or the Lightning Grenade. However, Pulse grenade would be easier to use, considering it cannot be destroyed like the Lightning grenade and does not require alignment.

One additional comment I would like to make is I *feel* like Lightning grenades apply additional stagger compared to the other grenades, but I cannot confirm that. It may or may not be true, additional testing is required for this.",12,26,2023-03-03 10:58:59,2023,3

hold on to your hats cause this is a fun one!!

elden ring is a dark souls prequel &gt;IF&lt; the 3 fingers ending is the ""true"" ending.

an all consuming flame to burn away the erd  and minor erd trees leaving the original arch trees. given everything and everyone is burned away everything would be grey and ashen. 

the dragons living in timeless farum azula would eventually migrate and become the everlasting dragons until the 4 great ones came across the last of the fire of frenzy (possibly in the very pit of the 3 fingers) 

and so Dark souls begins. which would give interesting ramifications for the series",7,8,2023-03-03 12:02:03,2023,3

But in CN, Cyno's title General Mahamatra is called ""Da Feng Ji Guan"", so he jokes that he is humbled by the giant windmills, why? Because the windmills are also a kind of ""Da Feng Ji Guan""/ ""Giant Wind Machine"". It is a one to one perfect pun.

In CN Cyno's jokes are all extremely precisely crafted bad puns, that you almost can't fault him because they are way too logical in nature. But it can't be translated well into EN so they just double downed and made his jokes actually bad.",87,1158,2023-03-03 12:03:23,2023,3

VALORANT,hikorue_501,Start spray controlling more and win,"Recently, I started to spray and spam more in my games. The reason was my attempt to climb to gold again and from watching pros from LOCK//IN.

Many people told me to not focus on headshots, because I showed them my tracker profile, and I had a 38+ HS%. But I liked hitting headshots because it felt way more satisfying.

But I eventually followed their advice because I saw a pro get 2 frags because the enemy trying to trade, ran into him doing a spray down.

And of course my HS% dropped dramatically but my KAST and ADR were higher, and I won more (but then I faced stronger players and got my butt kicked). And Tracker.gg's tracker score was higher as well (and the tracker score seemed to have a good correlation with my performance).

Here's why I think spraying and spamming has benefited me more:
- Chip damage. Even if I don't kill the enemy, if they're low, me or my teammates will have an easier time if we encounter them again. And they will most likely play more passively to stay alive.
- A lower time to kill. I can focus less on trying to lineup my crosshair to the head.
- Getting kills from spray downs and transfers.
- Getting kills from pre-spraying. This is mostly stupid but it's pretty effective when you know someone is about to peek you or to bait them into peeking you.

But here are drawbacks for me:
- It feels less satisfying.
- My headshot habits made me never crouch spray and I strafe shoot instead. So when I spray against people crouch spraying, they'll win because I'm not used to crouching to counter play. And I have to drag down hard if I'm standing and they're crouching.
- I'm easier to hit and it's difficult to reset from recoil on a spray.
- My tracking when spraying gets unstable because I play at high sens. I mostly used flicks and crosshair placement to hit my shots before.

But as you can notice, the drawbacks are mostly just things I can get used to over time.
Now, I'm just mixing burst firing, strafe shooting, dead zoning and spray + recoil control all together and using them appropriately based on the duel distance and situation. Hopefully I get used to it.

Feel free to give me more tips!
So far I'm silver 3 and I'm facing against people who used to be in plat or high gold in the last act, that are in silver now.",10,7,2023-03-03 12:05:26,2023,3

VALORANT,flavryu66,Rope Jump Mechanics,"Hi, so I have been trying this for about 2 hours and I just wanted to share this here because I did not find anything at all on the internet regarding this specific mechanic, so I hope this will help someone in the future.

I was having problems on quickly attaching and detaching from the rope, because if you do it normally, you can't just detach straight after attaching as there is a cooldown on the action. What I did not realise is that when you jump while attached, the rope ""pushes"" you away from it, detaching you. So when people do the Icebox rope boost jump (which is still possible in patch 6.03, as I just did it) what they *never* say is that you need to jump -&gt; attach when at the highest -&gt; ***JUMP AGAIN (mid air)*** \-&gt; rope pushes you forward. So you don't press the ""use"" button (default F) twice, but only once to attach to the rope.

Again, attach-detach fast *is not possible*, because there is a cooldown, so instead of detaching, you need to jump out of the rope.",7,20,2023-03-03 12:24:06,2023,3

We all know its a pretty huge update and pretty much reinstalls the whole game again, all 87gbs, so this was meant to take 7ish hours on my dogshit wifi at 3mbps download speed. Woke up this morning and the download had restarted or failed bc my pc went to sleep after i did. It was at 60% when i went to bed so i thought it was going  to be finished by the time i woke up. As soon as I realised it restarted the download I quickly started downloading it again. This was with about 8hrs before LF launch at 5. Cut to 1hr before launch and my update is at 77% complete (i have changed it on my PC so that when plugged in it doesn’t go to sleep at all after the previous update failed). I go downstairs and the moment i get back to my PC THE FUCKING UPDATE HAS FAILED AGAIN. So now I’m back to square fucking 0, light fall is 30mins away and I now can’t play on launch as I have to wait fucking 8hrs. I have also just uninstalled the game to see if that will prevent it from failing again. IS THIS HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE??? I am so fucking pissed off.",4,0,2023-02-28 16:40:02,2023,2

Minecraft,OneTelevision,HELP! I need to load an old save.,"Hello there

I have recently lost my minecraft world. I tried experimenting with shaders. I made a big mistake and loaded my world with 150+ hours sinked in to it, in minecraft 1.14.1. I tried using a new shader pack, and instead loaded an old shader pack, which is why the world loaded in minecraft version 1.14.1. My seed is still there, but my entire base I gone, and have been replaced with another biome. Everything that has been added after 1.14.1 has obviously been removed aswell, such as my fully stacked netherite gear.   
I haven't made a backup folder, and I was wondering if there is any chance, you can load an ""earlier"" save, before my grave mistake, and have my world back.

Please help me, I'm very desperate.",2,0,2023-02-28 16:41:13,2023,2

I looked it up and it lead me to this subreddit and it said that they can see and it is evident. But to what extent? How obvious it is? What does it look like?

From the image released we can see what looks like the erd tree, but in my opinion, it’s further away than any location I can think of.

Also, the character riding what appears to be torrent is surrounded by what looks like wheat, or reeds. So in my opinion we will be visiting the land of reeds, there will be a big increase on blood incantations/ sorceries and maybe we will be given a blood talisman.
I may be wrong but that’s just my opinion from what we’ve seen, perhaps we will visit Miquella in Moghs palace and either be transported there, as we know from lore it is a land that became obsessed with blood",1,1,2023-02-28 16:45:10,2023,2
